                <p>Many graphic tales have been told of
the immense loads of plunder carried
off during the fighting in Dublin; but
there has been looting on a large scale
elsewhere, if one may believe the

Bloomsbury."</p>

                <p>Says a writer in The <title>Daily Chronicle</title>:
"In one neighbourhood within the
Zeppelin zone there are hundreds of
partridges who defy the Defence of the
Realm Act. Two or three hours before
anyone else is aware that the baby-killers
are approaching these bold birds
go chuckle, chuckle, chuckle, as if there
were an army of the more human sort
of poachers about." Personally we
have always felt that the
section of the Defence of the
Realm Act which forbids one
to go chuckle, chuckle, chuckle,
when the Zeppelins are approaching
is superfluous as
well as in inferior taste.</p>

                <p>Dr. <name rend="sc">Walford Davis</name>, in a
lecture on "Songs for Home
Singing," recently told his

Bridges saved a couple of
battalions at the Front with
two penny whistles. We feel
bound to point out however
that any attempt to save the
nation with the same exiguous
weapons would be too hazardous
to be encouraged.</p>

                <p>Owing to a lack of the

picturesque salutation with which staff
officers are in the habit of taking
leave of one another, "So long, Old
Tape!" will not be allowed to become
obsolete.</p>

of —-. A Cavalry outpost recently

beasts and watch the antics of the
scavenger beetle, who extracts a precarious
livelihood from the sand by
rolling all refuse into little balls and
burying them. It is very hot.

                        <name rend="sc">My dear Charles</name>,—There comes a
time in the life of the military motor
when, owing to one thing or another
(but mostly another), it becomes a
casualty and retires, on the ground of
ill-health, to the Base. As such it is
towed into the nearest workshops; but,
before it departs to the Base there
arrive, from all corners of the Army
area, drivers of other similar motors,
coming, as you might say, "for a purpose."
These are the vultures who
have got to hear of the affair, are sorry
indeed that such mishaps should occur,
but, stifling their sorrow, see their way
to snaffle some little benefit for themselves.</p>
                    <p>One vulture will come to exchange
old lamps for new, another to
do a deal in magnetos, and a
third, may be, to better himself
in the matter of wheels.
There will be some squabbling,
and, when the work is done,
the last state of that casualty
will be worse than the first,
and it will proceed to the
Base a melancholy collection
of all the most dilapidated
parts in the area, for which
even the most optimistic
authority at the back of beyond
will see no useful future.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday the following interview
took place at my little
office, which is also my little
home and is very handsomely
and elaborately furnished with
a system of boxes, some to sit
on, some to write on and some
to go to sleep in.</p>
                    <p>"An officer to see you, Sir," said
the orderly, and in there came a
representative from Signals who was
pleased to meet me. I put aside my
work in order to deal with him politely,
firmly and once and for all.</p>
                    <p>"If," I said haughtily, "you are the
gentleman who rings me up on the
telephone every morning at 7 <name rend="sc">A.M.</name>, goes
on ringing me up till I creep to the
instrument and murmur 'Hello!' and
then tells me that is all and will I
please ring off, then I too am glad we
have met at last."</p>
                    <p>He denied the suggestion so hotly
that I unbent a little. I asked him to
be seated, and offered him a part of my
bed for the purpose.</p>
                    <p>"It's like this," he began.</p>
                    <p>"Is it?" said I. "Then no doubt
you want me to sign an Army Form
and take all the responsibility?"</p>
                    <p>"For what?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"I'm sure I don't know," I answered;
"and it doesn't much matter,
for I shall only pass it on to someone
else, please."</p>
                    <p>For once it wasn't an Army Form.
Was I not, he ventured to ask, the
proprietor of a small car?</p>
                    <p>"What was once a small car before
it met what was once a large telegraph
pole," I said thoughtlessly.</p>
                    <p>He was glad to hear this, as he too
was the owner of a small car. We
shook hands on that, though we knew
all the time that H.M. Government
was the owner of both. H.M. Government
not being present, however, to
insist on its rights, we were able to
do a quiet swank. In the course of it
he mentioned, quite by the way, the
matter of shock-absorbers. He had reason
to believe that my car could spare
his car a couple of these.</p>
                    <p>I saw the need for hedging. "That
telegraph pole I mentioned just now
wasn't really very large," I explained,
"and it came away quietly, offering no
resistance."</p>
                    <p>He smiled knowingly at that.</p>
                    <p>"Were <hi rend="it">you</hi>," I continued, fixing a cold
and relentless eye upon him—"were
you equally lucky with your—your—?"</p>
                    <p>"Small lorry," he said, with a faint
blush. "A tiny lorry, in fact."</p>
                    <p>"Not more than a dozen tons or so?"
I suggested. "No doubt it passed
quite gradually over you, frightening
more than hurting you, and you were
able to walk home with remainder
of small motor in pocket of greatcoat?"</p>
                    <p>He didn't go into that subject. "By
the way," he said, "I happened to be
round at the workshops just now——"</p>
                    <p>"Did you, indeed?" I took him up.
"Then let me tell you at once that the
wreckage in the workshop's yard was
not my small car, so you may abandon
any hopes you had built upon that."</p>
                    <p>He appeared to be surprised at the
attitude I adopted.</p>
                    <p>"No," he said slowly—"no, I knew
that wasn't <hi rend="it">your</hi> car."</p>
                    <p>I thought rapidly. "It was <hi rend="it">yours</hi>,"
I hazarded, "and your idea was to
re-equip that battered wreck at the
expense of my very slightly injured
property?"</p>
                    <p>He smiled shamelessly.</p>
                    <p>"You are a most unscrupulous
officer," I said, "and I'm beginning
to think you <hi rend="it">are</hi> the voice which gets
me out of bed—I mean, interrupts my
work—every morning at dawn."</p>
                    <p>"No, really," he replied, glad to have
something to be honest about. "At
that hour I am always in—at work
myself."</p>
                    <p>We shook hands again on that and I
offered him a cigarette.</p>
                    <p>"Have one of mine," said he.</p>
                    <p>"No, no," I pressed; "you
have one of mine."</p>
                    <p>Again, if the truth had been
admitted, H.M. Government
was the rightful owner of
both.</p>
                    <p>"Of course," he explained,
"you saw my little 'bus from
quite its worst aspect in that
yard."</p>
                    <p>I was for getting to business.
"I want," said I, "a
back axle-shaft, a head-light,
a wind-screen and some mud-guards.
What's yours?"</p>
                    <p>"I could do with a spare
wheel-holder, a horn, a couple
of yards of foot-board," he
said. "Two shock-absorbers
and at least one wheel I must
have."</p>
                    <p>A little discussion proved
that between us we could put up a
very decent car. The only difficulty
arose from a doubt as to what was to
happen when we went out in it. It
would still be a two-seater, and neither
of our chauffeurs was small enough to
be carried in the tool-box. Who was
going to drive, who was going to sit by
and, when occasion demanded, step out
and do the dirty work? Neither of
us seeing his way to give in on these
points, we had to think of some other
solution.</p>
                    <p>"You mentioned the workshops just
now," I said. "Were you going on to
say that the officer in charge told you
of another small car which was in
trouble?"</p>
                    <p>"He did," said Signals.</p>
                    <p>"Same here," said I. "Did he then
recommend you to get what you
wanted off that other car?"</p>
                    <p>"He did," said Signals.</p>
                    <p>"Same here," said I. "And did
you also ascertain that this officer in
<pb xml:id="page309" n="pg 309"/>
charge possesses a small car of his own
rich in standard parts?"</p>
                    <p>"I did," said Signals.</p>
                    <p>"Same here," said I. "Let us go
out and look for that——"</p>
                    <p>"Officer in charge," said Signals.</p>
                    <p>"No," said I, "his car." I felt that
we were justified, in the circumstances,
in dividing it between us.</p>
                    <p>But there is no limit to these officers
in charge of workshops. We had the
greatest difficulty in finding his car at
all, and, when we did, it had the
appearance of being deliberately concealed.
Worse still; when we found
the car we found also a sentry standing
over it, with rifle and fixed bayonet.
Though we took this to be a direct
insult to ourselves, we were too proud
to go and expostulate with the officer
himself about it.</p>
                    <p>Yours ever,  <name rend="sc">Henry</name>.</p>

                <quote type="note">(From Captain Claude Seaforth to a
novelist friend.)</quote>
                <p>
                    <name rend="sc">My dear Man</name>,—You asked me to
tell you if anything very remarkable
came my way. I think I have a story
for you at last. If I could only write
I would make something of it myself,
but not being of Kitchener's Army I
can't.</p>
                <p>The other day, while I was clearing
up papers and accounts and all over
ink, as I always get, the Sergeant came
to me, looking very rum. "Two young
fellows want to see you," he said.</p>
                <p>Of course I said I was too busy and
that he must deal with them.</p>
                <p>"I think you'd rather see them yourself,"
he said, with another odd look.</p>
                <p>"What do they want?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"They want to enlist," he said; "but
they don't want to see the doctor."</p>
                <p>We've had some of these before—consumptives
of the bull-dog breed, you
know. Full of pluck but no mortal use;
"done in" on the first route march.</p>
                <p>"Why don't you tell them that they
must see the doctor and have done
with it?" I asked the Sergeant.</p>
                <p>Again he smiled queerly. "I made
sure you'd rather do it yourself," he
said. "Shall I send them in?"</p>
                <p>So I wished them further and said
"Yes;" and in they came.</p>
                <p>They were the prettiest boys you
ever saw in your life—too pretty. One
had red hair and the other black, and
they were dressed like navvies. They
held their caps in their hands.</p>
                <p>"What's this rubbish about not
seeing a doctor?" I asked. You know
my brutal way.</p>
                <p>"We thought perhaps it could be
dispensed with," Red Hair said, drawing
nearer to Black Hair.</p>
                <p>"Of course it can't," I told them.
"What's the use to the Army of
weaklings who can't stand the strain?
They're just clogs in the machinery.
Don't you see that?"</p>
                <p>"We're very strong," Red Hair said,
"only——"</p>
                <p>"Only what?"</p>
                <p>"Only——"  Here they looked at
each other, and Red Hair said, "Shall
we?" and Black Hair said, "Yes;"
and they both came closer to me.</p>
                <p>"Will you promise," said Red Hair,
"that you will treat as confidential
anything we say to you?"</p>
                <p>"So long as it is nothing dangerous
to the State," I said, rather proud of
myself for thinking of it.</p>
                <p>"We want to fight for our country,"
Red Hair began.</p>
                <p>"No one wants to fight more," Black
Hair put in.</p>
                <p>"And we're very strong," Red Hair
continued.</p>
                <p>"I won a cup for lawn-tennis at
Devonshire Park," Black Hair added.</p>
                <p>"But," said Red Hair.</p>
                <p>"Yes?" I replied.</p>
                <p>"Don't you believe in some women
being as strong as men?"</p>
                <p>"Certainly," I said.</p>
                <p>"Well then," said Red Hair, "that's
<pb xml:id="page310" n="pg 310"/>
like us. We are as strong as lots of
men and much keener, and we want
you to be kind to us and let us enlist."</p>
                <p>"We'll never do anything to give
ourselves away," said Black Hair; but,
bless her innocent heart, she was
giving herself away all the time.
Every moment was feminine.</p>
                <p>"My dear young ladies," I said at
last, "I think you are splendid and an
example to the world; but what you
ask is impossible. Have you thought
for a moment what it would be like
to find yourselves in barracks with the
ordinary British soldier? He is a
brave man and, when you meet him
alone, he is nearly always a nice man;
but collectively he might not do as
company for you."</p>
                <p>"But look at this," said Red Hair,
showing me a newspaper-cutting about
a group of Russian girls known as
"The Twelve Friends," who have been
through the campaign and were treated
with the utmost respect by the soldiers.</p>
                <p>"And there's a woman buried at
Brighton," said Black Hair, "who
fought as a man for years and lived to
be a hundred."</p>
                <p>"And think of <name rend="sc">Joan of Arc</name>," said
Red Hair.</p>
                <p>"And <name rend="sc">Boadicea</name>," said Black Hair.</p>
                <p>"Well," I said, "leaving <name rend="sc">Joan of
Arc</name> and <name rend="sc">Boadicea</name> aside, possibly those
Russians and that Brighton woman
looked like men, which it is certain
you don't. But any way we must be
serious. What would your people
say?"</p>
                <p>"We left word," said Red Hair,
"that we were going off to do something
for our country. They won't
worry. Oh, please be kind and help
us!"</p>
                <p>Here all four of their beautiful eyes
grow moist.</p>
                <p>I could have hugged both of them,
but I kept an iron hand on myself.</p>
                <p>"You nice absurd creatures," I said,
"do be reasonable. To begin with,
passing the doctor is an absolute
necessity. That shuts you out. But
even if you got through how do
you think you would be helping your
country? All the men would be falling
in love with you; and that's bad
enough as it is after working hours;
it would be the ruin of discipline. And
you could not bear the fatigue. No,
go back and learn to be nurses and let
your lovely hair grow again."</p>
                <p>They were very obstinate and very
unwilling to entertain the thought of
drudgery such as nursing after all their
dreams of excitement; but at last they
came to reason, and I sent for a cab
and packed them off in it (I simply
could not bear the idea of other people
seeing them in that masquerade), and
told them that the sooner they changed
the better.</p>
                <p>After they had gone the Sergeant
came in about something.</p>
                <p>I said nothing, and he said nothing,
each of us waiting for the other.</p>
                <p>He moved about absolutely silently,
and I dared not meet his glance because
I knew I should give myself away.
The rascal has not been running his
eye over young women all these years
without being able to spot them in a
moment, even in navvy's clothes.</p>
                <p>At last I could stand it no longer.
"Damn it," I said, "what are you
doing? Why don't you go? I didn't
send for you." But still I didn't dare
look up.</p>
                <p>"I thought perhaps you had something
to say to me, Sir," he said.</p>
                <p>"No, I haven't," I replied. "Why
should I? What about?"</p>
                <p>"Only about those two young men,
Sir," he replied.</p>
                <p>"Get out," I said; but before he
could go I had burst into laughter.</p>
                <p>"Better not mention it," I managed
to say.</p>
                <p>He promised.</p>
                <p>There—won't you find that useful?</p>
                <p>Yours,   C. S.</p>

                <head>A VERY RARE BIRD.</head>
                <p>Brown lives next door but one to
me. His speciality is birds, and he
must be a frightful nuisance to them.
I shouldn't care to be a bird if Brown
knew where my nest was. It isn't
that he takes their eggs. If he would
merely rob them and go away it
wouldn't matter so much. They could
always begin again after a decent interval.
But a naturalist of the modern
school doesn't want a bird's eggs; he
wants to watch her sitting on them.
Now sitting is a business that demands
concentration, a strong effort of the
will and an undistracted mind. How
on earth is a bird to concentrate when
she knows perfectly well that Brown,
disguised as a tree or a sheep or a
haycock, is watching her day after
day for hours at a stretch and snap-shotting
her every five minutes or so
for some confounded magazine? In
nine cases out of ten she lets her
thoughts wander and ends half unconsciously
by posing, with the result
that most of her eggs don't hatch out.</p>
                <p>Brown has a highly-trained sense of
hearing. You and I, of course, possess
pretty good ears for ordinary purposes.
We can catch as soon as anyone else
that muffled midnight hum, as of a
distant threshing-machine beneath a
blanket, which advertises the approach
of the roaming Zepp. From constant
practice, too, we have learnt, sitting in
our drawing room or study, to distinguish
the crash of the overturned
nursery table upstairs from the duller,
less resonant thud of baby's head as
it strikes the floor.  But can we positively
state from the note of the blackbird
at the bottom of the garden
whether it has three, four or five eggs
in its nest, or indeed if it is a house-holder
at all? No, we cannot; but
Brown can.</p>
                <p>Even specialists, however, occasionally
make mistakes. A day or two
ago, just as dusk was falling, Brown
entered my house in a state of considerable
excitement and informed me
that a pair of reed-warblers were building
in my orchard.</p>
                <p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"Quite," he replied. "I have not
actually seen the birds yet, but I have
heard them from my own garden, and
of course the note of the nesting reed-warbler
is unmistakable."</p>
                <p>"Of course," I agreed.</p>
                <p>"It is a most extraordinary occurrence,"
he continued, "most extraordinary."</p>
                <p>"You mean because there are no
reeds there?"</p>
                <p>"Exactly."</p>
                <p>I was quite certain in my own mind
that there were no reed-warblers either,
but I felt it would be impertinent for
a layman like myself to argue with
Brown.</p>
                <p>"There!" he exclaimed, darting to
the open window. "Can't you hear it?"</p>
                <p>I listened. "Oh, that," I said;
"that's——"</p>
                <p>"The mating song of the male reed-warbler,"
interrupted Brown ecstatically.
"Now, whatever happens, don't
let them be disturbed. Don't even try
to find the nest, or you may alarm
them. Leave it all to me. I shan't
have a free morning till Saturday,
but there's no hurry. I'll bring my
camera round then, and when I've
located the spot they're building in
I'll rig up a hiding-place and take
some photos. Don't let anybody go
near them; the great thing is to make
them feel quite at home." He was
gone before I could explain.</p>
                <p>It is rather an awkward situation,
because, when Brown comes on Saturday
morning, I am afraid that if he
secures any really successful photos
they will prove a disappointment to
him. They will represent my gardener,
Williams, trundling a barrow, the wheel
of which is badly in need of oil.</p>

                <p>
                    <title>Tuesday, May 2nd.</title>—The House of
Commons was unusually well attended
this afternoon.  Members filled the
benches and overflowed into the galleries,
and many Peers looked down upon
the scene, among them Lord <name rend="sc">Grenfell</name>,
formerly Commander-in-Chief in Ireland,
and Lord <name rend="sc">MacDonnell</name>, once
Under-Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant.
All were curious to learn what the <name rend="sc">Prime
Minister</name> would have to say about
the painful events of the past week.
Would he announce that the Government,
conscious of failure, had decided
to resign <title>en bloc</title>? Or would it be
merely pruned and strengthened by
the lopping of a few of the obviously
weaker branches?</p>
                <p>Nothing of the sort. Mr. <name rend="sc">Asquith</name>
made the barest allusion to the surrender
of Kut—an incident
which was "not one
of serious military significance."
As for the insurrection
in Dublin, there
would be a debate upon
it as soon as the Government
had completed its
enquiries. The main purpose
of his speech was
to announce that the
Government had decided
to introduce a Bill for
general compulsion, and
to get rid of the piece-meal
treatment of recruiting
to which the House
had objected. Members
were, I think, hardly prepared
for the vigour with
which the <name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name>
turned upon his critics, reminding them
that just the same denunciation of
"vacillating statesmen" was current
in the days of <name rend="sc">Pitt</name>. No doubt there
had been blunders both in policy and
strategy, but nevertheless the contribution
of this Kingdom and this
Empire to the common cause was
growing steadily, and the military
situation of the Allies was never so
good as it was to-day. If the Government
no longer had the confidence of
the people, he thundered out, "let the
House say so."</p>
                <p>While the immediate answer to this
challenge was a volley of cheers, most
of the speakers in the subsequent debate
disguised their confidence in the
Government so successfully that it
almost appeared to be non-existent.
From Sir <name rend="sc">Edward Carson</name>, who acidly
remarked that it was unnecessary for
him to praise the Government, as
"they always do that for themselves,"
down to Sir <name rend="sc">John Simon</name>, who declared
that compulsion was being introduced
from considerations of political expediency
rather than military necessity, no
one seemed to be convinced that the
Government even now quite knew its
own mind.</p>
                <p>The House of Lords, after listening
to a moving tribute to the memory
of Lord <name rend="sc">St. Aldwyn</name> from his old colleague,
Lord <name rend="sc">Lansdowne</name>, settled down
to a debate on the new Order in Council
prohibiting references to Cabinet
secrets. It met with equal condemnation
from Lord <name rend="sc">Parmoor</name> as a
constitutional lawyer and from Lord
<name rend="sc">Burnham</name> as a practical journalist.
The Ministers who "blabbed" were the
real criminals. Lord <name rend="sc">Burnham</name> recommended
to them the example of the
gentleman in the French Revolution,
who always wore a gag in order to
retain his self-control.</p>
                <p>Lord <name rend="sc">Buckmaster</name>, that "most susceptible
Chancellor," made a very
ingenuous defence of his colleagues.
They were the unconscious victims of
adroit interviewers, who obtained information
from them by a process of
extraction so painless that they did
not know the value of what they were
giving away.</p>
                <p>It is time that these innocents were
protected against themselves. A gag
must in future be issued to every Minister
with his Windsor uniform. The
discarded G.R. armlets of the V.T.C.
might very well serve the purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Wednesday, May 3rd</title>.—When, some
nine years ago, Mr. <name rend="sc">Augustine Birrell</name>
was appointed Chief Secretary to the
Lord-Lieutenant a friend who had
some knowledge of Irish affairs wrote
to him: "I do not know whether to congratulate
you or condole with you, but
I think it is the latter."</p>
                <p>It was an easy guess, but its confirmation
took an unusually long time.
Indeed, at one moment it looked as if
Mr. <name rend="sc">Birrell</name> would escape the almost
invariable fate of Irish Secretaries, and
leave Dublin with his political reputation
enhanced. When he had placed
the National University Act on the
Statute-book, thus solving a problem
that had baffled his predecessors since
the Union, he might have sung his
<title>Nunc Dimittis</title> in a halo.</p>
                <p>Perhaps he was not sufficiently ambitious
to demand release; perhaps
none of his colleagues was anxious to
take his job; perhaps the Nationalist
leader insisted on keeping him
in the silken fetters of office as a hostage
for Home Rule. Anyhow, the
opportunity was missed; and thenceforward
Nemesis dogged his track.</p>
                <p>Two years ago it seemed that Ulster
would be his stumbling-block. The
War saved him from that, but only to
bring him down through more sinister
instruments. In his pathetic apology
this afternoon he confessed
that he had failed
to estimate accurately the
strength of the Sinn Fein
movement. He might
have been wrong in not
suppressing it before, but
his omission to do so was
due to a consuming desire
to keep Ireland's front
united in face of the common
foe.</p>
                <p>This frank admission of
error would in any case
have disarmed hostile criticism;
but its effect was
strengthened by the unseemly
interjections with
which Mr. <name rend="sc">Ginnell</name> accompanied
it. If the
Member for Westmeath
is a sample of the sort of persons with
whom the <name rend="sc">Chief Secretary</name> had to deal,
no wonder that he failed to understand
the lengths to which they would go.</p>
                <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">Redmond</name>, obviously disgusted
by the pranks of his nominal supporter,
chivalrously shouldered part of
the blame that Mr. <name rend="sc">Birrell</name> had taken
upon himself; and even Sir <name rend="sc">Edward
Carson</name>, though a life-long and bitter
opponent of his policy, was ready to
admit that he had been well-intentioned
and had done his best.</p>
                <p>Later on, when the <name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name>
had introduced the new Military Service
Bill, establishing compulsion for
all men married or single, Colonel <name rend="sc">Craig</name>
made a vain appeal to Mr. <name rend="sc">Redmond</name>
to get the measure extended to Ireland.
Nothing would do more to show the
world that the recent rebellion was
only the work of an insignificant
section of the Irish people.</p>

                    <title>Thursday, May 4th</title>.—Although Mr.
<name rend="sc">Ginnell</name> was one of the Members
to whom the Government were
<pb xml:id="page315" n="pg 315"/>
ready a week ago to impart secrets of
State with which the Press was not
deemed fit to be trusted, I gather that
he has other sources of information
which he considers much more trustworthy.
Among various tit-bits with
which he regaled the House this afternoon
was a suggested reason why
British aircraft have not yet bombarded
Essen. He has his suspicions that it is
because members of the British Cabinet
have shares in some of <name rend="sc">Frau Krupp's</name>
subsidiary companies.</p>
                <p>Most people know that all leave from
the Front was stopped just before
Easter, and have hitherto assumed
that the stoppage was due to the
exigencies of the military situation.
To Mr. <name rend="sc">Peto</name>, an earnest seeker after
truth, as befits his name, Mr. <name rend="sc">Tennant</name>
admitted that there was another reason.
Last year, it seems, some returning
warriors got so much mixed up in the
congested Easter traffic that they never
reached home at all, so this year the
authorities resolved to keep them out
of the danger-zone.</p>
                <p>The Government welcomes any suggestion
that may help to win the War.
Mr. <name rend="sc">Eugene Wason's</name> latest idea is
that if the War Office and the Admiralty
were to put their heads together they
might make it easier for outdoor artists
in Cornwall to obtain permits to pursue
their studies, at present restricted,
in military areas; and Mr. <name rend="sc">Tennant</name>
assured him that this important matter
was still "under consideration."</p>
                <p>The Second Reading of the Military
Service Bill brought forth some rather
trite arguments from Mr. <name rend="sc">Holt</name> and
other opponents of compulsion, and a
lively defence from Mr. <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name>,
who thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity,
after a long silence, of being
able to speak his mind without fear of
complications with his colleagues.
With examples drawn from France and
the American Civil War he argued that
compulsory service was an essential
incident of true democracy. But an
even more effective backing for the Bill
came from Mr. <name rend="sc">Arthur Henderson</name>.
Hitherto, according to his own description,
"the heaviest drag-weight of the
Cabinet," he now lent it increased
momentum, and carried with him into
the Lobby all but nine of his colleagues
of the Labour Party. Altogether, Sir
<name rend="sc">John Simon</name> and his friends mustered
just three dozen, and the Second Reading
was carried against them by a
majority of 292.</p>

                <head>THE LUCKIEST MAN.</head>
                <p>We were talking, the other night,
about lucky people. Barmer declared
that he knew the man (of whom we
had all of us heard) who was left a
large fortune by an eccentric old gentleman
whose hat he had picked up on
a windy day at Brighton. A better
and more original contribution to
the discussion was that of Bastable,
a retired Anglo-Indian. I give it as
nearly as I can in his own words.
"The luckiest man I ever met," he
said, "is my groom-gardener, Andrews.
I don't mean to say in respect of prosperity
or health, for he is a delicate
man, and I can only afford to give
him a modest wage. But he has a
charmed life, as you will admit when
you hear of his three escapes.</p>
                <p>"Number 1 was when he was employed
in repairing the roof of one of
the big London stations. He was
slung up in a cradle when he lost
his balance and fell to the ground—a
distance of about 80 feet. The odds
were about a million to one that he
would be killed, but he managed to
light on precisely the one spot in the
whole station area which secured him
a soft fall—a barrel of butter which
was standing on the platform, and from
which, for some reason or other, the
lid had been removed. The butter
was ruined, but Andrews escaped with
a bad shaking. I believe the butter-merchant
brought an action against
the Company, but I forget what happened.</p>
                <p>"Number 2 grew out of Andrews's
weakness for parrots. He had bought
a parrot from a sailor, who told him
that the best way to teach it to speak
was to hang the cage in a well and
repeat the words or phrases to it at
3 <name rend="sc">A.M.</name> in the morning, so as to secure
the greatest freedom from disturbance.
Andrews was then employed in a brewery
at Watford, and lived in a cottage
with a strip of garden at the back.
There was also a well, so that he could
carry out the sailor's instructions on
the spot. The cage, which was a large
one and nearly filled the well, was
made fast to the bucket apparatus, and
the first two lessons passed off without
any incident. But on the third night,
when Andrews was hard at work, he
was hailed by a policeman, who came
along the lane at the side of the garden—it
was an end house—and asked him
what he was doing. When Andrews said
that he was teaching his parrot to talk,
the policeman, naturally suspecting that
he was there for some felonious purpose,
climbed over the wall and made
a grab at him. It was a dark night,
and, in trying to dodge the policeman,
Andrews stepped into the well, which,
according to his account, was ninety
feet deep. But, as good luck would
have it, he got jammed between the
cage and the side of the well, and remained
hung up until the policeman
hauled him out with the aid of the
bucket rope. He was badly bruised,
but got all right in a few days.</p>
                <p>"Andrews's third and last escape
was in the War. He was a reservist,
went out early, saw a lot of fighting
and came through without a scratch
till last November, when his trench
was rushed and he was taken prisoner.
The front trenches at that point were
only about forty yards apart, and before
he was removed to the rear a British
shell lit close to him and blew him
back into his own lines. He was badly
hurt and, after some months in hospital,
was invalided out of the Army,
but manages to do the light work I
want all right."</p>
                <p>We all subscribed to Bastable's view
of Andrews's luck—all at least except
Barmer, who was a little nettled at
having his story eclipsed. "I can believe
the yarn about the shell," he said,
"but the butter story is a bit thick, and
all tales about parrots are suspect."</p>

                    <p>During one of the intervals which
served so well to eke out the brief two
hours of Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell's</name> new "comedy,"
and were quite as good as many things
in the play, I allowed my mind—an
absolute blank—to dwell upon certain
arresting features in the stage curtain
of the St. James's Theatre. In the
centre, imposed upon a design whose
significance I do not pretend to penetrate,
is a gigantic wreath encircling a
monogram of the magic initials, G. A.,
which are surmounted by something
which I took to be an heraldic top-hat.
This headpiece is in turn surmounted
by an heraldic eagle—the ordinary
arrangement by which the helmet appears
above the coat-of-arms being thus
reversed. The central design is flanked
on each side by two other wreaths,
massive but subordinate. Within the
sinister wreath is enshrined in Greek
capitals the letters ALEX, and within
the dexter wreath the letters ANDROS.
"Reading from left to right" we have
here the historic name of the Macedonian
monarch.</p>
                    <p>I cannot account for the Greek form
of the name on the ground that the
St. James's Theatre is the home of the
Classical Drama, for the themes of its
plays seldom go back beyond the later
decades of the 19th century A.D., and
I can only conclude that it is meant
to indicate that the conquests of Sir
<name rend="sc">George Alexander's</name> company resemble
those of the famous phalanx of his
namesake, the Great.</p>
                    <p>Most theatres have an atmosphere
of their own, and it would be hard to
recall any play at the St. James's that
has been less in keeping with the local
climate than this comedy, so described,
of Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell's</name>. On the score of impropriety
and improbability it might
in the old days have appealed to the
Criterion management; but its lack of
broad humour must have negatived these
advantages. In any case Sir <name rend="sc">George
Alexander's</name> house was no place for a
farce so out of harmony with Macedonian
methods.</p>
                    <p>Almost its solitary interest lay in
the doubt, maintained to the last
moment, as to which of its many
fatuous males would turn out to be
the hero—meaning by hero the chosen
husband of the heroine, for none of
them had any personal claim to the
title. Indeed, the choice ultimately
fell upon the one that had the least
distinctive personality of all, his disguise
being kept up by a kind of
protective colourlessness.</p>
                    <p>But for Miss <name rend="sc">Ellis Jeffreys</name>, who
played the aunt of the preposterous
<title>Lady Pen</title> with a courage worthy of a
better cause, and extracted from the
play such humour as it held for her,
matters would have gone badly for
those of us who have been accustomed
to look to Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell</name> for entertainment.
Mr. <name rend="sc">Allan Aynesworth</name>, as the
heroine's guardian, had no difficulty in
transmitting pleasantly enough his mild
share of the fun. Miss <name rend="sc">Marie Hemingway</name>
needed all her prettiness to make
up for the futility of her part. And I
was really sorry that so sound an
actor as Mr. <name rend="sc">Dawson Milward</name> should
have had such ineffective stuff put into
his mouth.</p>
                    <p>Far the funniest thing about the play
was the fact that so clever and experienced
a writer should have made it.
Perhaps the compliments I have paid
to my friend Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell</name> in these
columns have given me the right to
beg him not to take advantage of his
many recent successes and palm off on
the public just any kind of banality,
For these are days when pens (with or
without a big P) must be pretty good if
they are to compete with the sword.</p>
                    <p>With this appeal (and with a silent
prayer that the play may not come by
a natural death in time for my homily
to serve as a funeral appreciation) I
hasten to conclude, hoping that it will
find, him in the pink (as they say)
of a blushful remorse; and, anyhow, I
remain,   His sincerely,  O. S.</p>

                    <p>It is pleasant to find that even in these days the revival
of interest in volumes of short stories still continues. But
of course the stories must have a certain quality. I am
glad to think that <title>Traveller's Samples</title> (<name rend="sc">Mills and Boon</name>)
will help forward the movement. Mrs. <name rend="sc">Henry Dudeney</name>
has a quite excellent touch for this sort of thing; her tales
are both atmospheric and, for their length, astonishingly
full of character. Also she has an engaging habit of avoiding
the expected. Take one of the best in this present
book, called "<title>John</title>," for instance. It is the slightest possible
thing, just a picture of a schoolboy's hopeless love for a
shallow cruel-brained girl eight years older than himself,
who is in process of getting engaged to an eligible bachelor.
But every figure in the little group lives. And the second
part, which tells the return of the boy-lover twelve years
later, shows you what I mean about Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dudeney's</name>
refreshing originality. I doubt if there are many writers
who would have finished off the story in her very satisfactory
way. There is one quality characteristic of most
of the tales—a feeling for middle-age in men and women;
many of them seem to be variations upon the same theme
of a love that comes by waiting. Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dudeney</name> can
handle this situation with unfailing charm. Her confessed
comedies are by far the weakest things in the book; there
is one of them indeed that seemed to me amazingly pointless.
But with this exception I can commend her volume
whole-heartedly, and only hope that the author will continue
to send out goods of such excellent workmanship,
"as per" (whatever that means) these attractive samples.</p>
                    <p>Those who search for minor compensations have affected
to find one in the idea that the actual happening of the
World War has removed from us the old fictional scares,
novels of German super-spies, and unsuspecting islanders
taken unprepared. But to think this is to reckon without
the ingenuity of such writers as Mr. <name rend="sc">Ridgwell Cullum</name>.
He, for example, has but to postulate that worst nightmare
of all, an inconclusive peace, and we are back in the former
terrors, blacker than ever. Suppose the Polish inventor of
German undersea craft to have been so stricken with
remorse at the frightful results thereof that he determines
to hand all his secrets to the English Government, in the
person of a young gentleman who combines the positions
of Cabinet Minister, son and heir to a great shipbuilder,
and hero of the story; suppose, moreover, that the said
inventor was blessed with an only daughter, of radiant
beauty and the rather conspicuous name of <title>Vita Vladimir</title>;
suppose the inevitable romance, a secret submarine expedition
to the island where Germany is maturing her felonious
little plans, the destruction of the latest frightfulness,
retaliation by Prussian myrmidons, abductions, murders,
and I don't know what besides—and you will have some
faint idea of the tumultuous episodes of <title>The Men Who
Wrought</title> (<name rend="sc">Chapman and Hall</name>). To say that the story
moves is vastly to understate its headlong rapidity of
action. And, while I hardly fancy that the characters
themselves will carry overwhelming conviction, there
<pb xml:id="page320" n="pg 320"/>
remains, in the theory of the submersible liner and
application to political facts, enough genuine wisdom to lift
the tale out of the company of six-shilling shockers. To
this extent at least <title>The Men Who Wrought</title> combines
instruction with entertainment.</p>

                        <title>Inter-Arma</title> (<name rend="sc">Heinemann</name>) is the title that Mr. <name rend="sc">Edmund
Gosse</name> has given to his latest volume of essays, reprinted
from <title>The Edinburgh Review</title>. No one who loves clarity of
style will need assurance about the quality of these studies,
which, with one exception, are concerned with some or other
aspect of the world-struggle. In "War and Literature,"
a paper dated during the black days of October, 1914, the
author attempts to realise what will be the probable literary
effect of the catastrophe by recounting the various ways
in which French writers suffered from that of 1870. An
interesting prediction, too, as recalling what many of us
believed at the beginning of the war, is this about the
future of English letters: "What we must really face is
the fact that this harvest of volumes [the autumn publishings
of 1914] will mark
the end of what is called
'current literature' for the
remaining duration of the
war. There can be no aftermath,
we can aspire to no
revival. The book which does
not deal directly and crudely
with the complexities of warfare
and the various branches
of strategy will, from Christmas
onwards, not be published
at all." As they stand, these
words might well serve as a
mild tonic for "current pessimism";
not even the paper
famine has brought them to
fulfilment. Elsewhere in the
volume is an instructive
paper on "The Neutrality of
Sweden" (valuable but vexatious,
as are all the indictments
of our insular apathy
in the matter of influencing
foreign opinion), and two or
three interesting studies of
French life and letters under the conditions of war. In
fine, a book full of scholarly grace, such as may well achieve
the writer's hope, expressed in his preface, of renewing the
friendship he has already made with those readers "whose
minds have become attuned to his," though they are now
"separated from him by leagues of sea and occupied in
noble and unprecedented service."</p>

                    <p>The author of <title>The Dop Doctor</title>, with her expansive style,

concern <title>The Macwaugh</title>, a shocking bad artist with an
immense thirst and the heftiest of Scotch accents. I don't
think that there ever was or could be anybody like <title>Macwaugh</title>,
or indeed that people talk or act like the majority
of the characters in this book; but that's where, perhaps,
"<name rend="sc">Richard Dehan</name>" scores a point or two off those realists
who mistake accuracy of detail for art. This amiable
drunkard, though absurd, lives and moves. The author is
evidently attached to him, and that helps. She has, indeed,
something of the Dickensian exuberance which carries off
absurdities and crudities that would otherwise be intolerably
tiresome. She even seems to get some fun out of this
kind of thing:—"'Write,' commanded the Zanouka with a
double-barrelled flash of her great eyes;" or, again, "It's all
poppycock and bumblepuppy," meaning, just, it isn't true.</p>

that is peculiarly his own. Cynics indeed may find his perfection
a little cloying, and may say with some justification
that no human child ever radiated so much joy and happiness.
All the same, this simple tale of childhood will

(the only one that has anything
to do with the War) is a
spirited yarn of the turning of
the tables on a German secret
service agent, with plenty
of atmosphere and hurrying
action.  The rest are light
studies of American life, of
which I chiefly commend an
extravaganza set in Hayti with
a resourceful Yankee electrician, as hero, in conflict with
the President in the matter of overdue wages; and the
final item of a tussle between a stern and upright District
Attorney and the might of Tammany, in which the author
seems to have a rather whimsical mistrust of both sides. I
always like to think of Tammany when our croakers are
holding up everything in this poor little island to obloquy.</p>
