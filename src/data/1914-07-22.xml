                <p>Hearing from an undergraduate
friend at Cardinal College of the impending
retirement of Mr. Chumbleton
("Old Chum"), the famous porter of
Salisbury Gate, I gladly seized the
opportunity of running down to Oxford
to gain some fresh sidelights on the
inner life of the University. Cardinal
College, unlike Balliol, Magdalen and
New College, has never shown itself
responsive to the new spirit. There
are probably fewer Socialists in Peckover
than in any other quad in Oxford.
The old feudal traditions, though somewhat
mitigated, still survive. You still
hear the characteristic Mayfair accent
and recognise a curious lack of that
Moral Uplift without which, as Sir
<name rend="sc">Robertson Nicoll</name> finely says, a man is
no better than a mummy. And yet I own
to having been strangely attracted by
these well-groomed scions of a vanishing
breed, with their finely chiselled
features, their clipped colloquialisms
and their cheerful arrogance. There is
something engaging as well as pathetic
in these unruffled countenances, blind
to the realities of modern life and the
need of that fraternal fellowship which
alone can bring peace to the head that
wears a crown or a coronet.</p>
                <p>Mr. Chumbleton, who was just going
off duty when I arrived, cordially invited
me into his inner sanctum and
offered me a glass of gin and green
Chartreuse, the favourite beverage, he
assured me, of the late Duke of Midhurst,
whose scout he had been in
the "seventies." Of that strange and
meteoric figure, who was subsequently
devoured by a crocodile on the Blue
Nile, Mr. Chumbleton spoke with
genuine affection. "He was something
like a Dook," said the old man, "and
not one of your barley-water-drinking
faddists. Yes, in those days a Dook was
a Dook and not a cock-shy for demigods
[? demagogues]. I can remember,"
he went on, "when there wore three
Dooks in residence at the same time,
the Dook of Midhurst, the Dook of
St. Ives and the Dook of Clumber.
But the Dook of Midhurst was the
pick of the bunch. Why, once he went
into a grocer's shop in the High and
asked for two pounds of treacle. 'How
will you have it?' asked the grocer,
who was the baldest-headed man I ever
seen. 'In my hat,' said the Dook,
whipping off his bowler and holding it
out. As soon as it was full, before you
could say Jack Robinson, he popped
it on the grocer's head and ran out of
the shop."</p>
                <p>The old man told this terrible story,
which reminded me of the worst
cruelties of the despots of the Italian
Renaissance, with a gusto that was
inexpressibly painful. When he had
finished I asked whether the Duke was
sent down. "Oh, no, Sir," was the
prompt response. "You see the grocer,
being a bald-headed man, had no
trouble with the treacle, and, besides,
the Dook he gave him a wig next day.
But if anyone was to do that to-day,
Dook or no Dook, there'd be questions
asked about it in the House of Commons,
or a Royal Commission would
be appointed. Times is changed," he
went on sadly, "and there ain't any
more of the old stock left. Why, the
Bullingdon Club got three First Classes
this year, and as for breaking up furniture
and bonfires in the quad it don't
happen once in three years. 'Nuts'
they call 'em now, but when I was a
young scout they called 'em 'dogs,' and
gay dogs they were, I can tell you.
'Bloods' they call 'em, too, but there
ain't much blue blood in these modern
Blutocrats."</p>
                <p>I asked Mr. Chumbleton if there
were any signs of Cardinal College
being affected by the new Moral Uplift,
but he seemed unable to fathom the
meaning of my query. His standpoint
was clearly philistine and, I regret to
say, distinctly pagan. He had never
heard of the Land Campaign, or of
Mr. <name rend="sc">Hemmerde</name>, Baron <name rend="sc">de Forest</name> or
even Mr. <name rend="sc">Harold Begbie</name>. His attitude
towards Mr. <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name> was unsympathetic.
He deplored the popularity
of motor-bicycles, but, with a
strange and lamentable perversity, welcomed
the advent of the motor-'bus
while condemning the introduction of
trams.</p>
                <p>I came away more than ever impressed
by the tenacity of feudal traditions,
and the need of redoubled efforts
on the part of all Radical stalwarts to
convert the older universities from hotbeds
of expensive obscurantism into
free nurseries of humanitarian democracy.
It was sad to see such a
figure as that of Mr. Chumbleton,
genial and hospitable, I admit, but
utterly heedless of the trend of the
times, hopelessly ignorant of the Progressive
program, and deriving a senile
satisfaction from memories of a barbarous
and brutal past.</p>

                <head>ONCE UPON A TIME.</head>
                <p rend="center">
                    <name rend="sc">Transmigration.</name>
                </p>
                <p>Once upon a time there was an
ostrich who, though very ostrichy, was
even more of an egoist. He thought
only of himself. That is not a foible
peculiar to ostriches, but this particular
fowl—and he was very particular—was
notable for it. "Where do I come in?"
was a question written all over him—from
his ridiculous and inadequate head,
down his long neck, on his plump
fluffy body, and so to his exceedingly
flat and over-sized feet.</p>
                <p>It was in Afric's burning sand—to
be precise, at the Cape—that, on the
approach of danger, the ostrich secreted
his self-centred head, and here from
time to time his plumes were plucked
from him for purposes of trade.</p>
                <p>Now it happened that in London
there was a theatre given up to a season
of foreign opera, and, this theatre
having been built by one of those
gifted geniuses so common among
theatre architects, it followed that the
balcony (into which, of course, neither
the architect nor the manager for whom
it was built had ever strayed) contained
a number of seats from which
no view of the stage was visible at all—unless
one stood up, and then the people
behind were deprived of their view.
This, of course, means nothing to
architects or managers. The thought
that jolly anticipatory parties of simple
folk bent upon a happy evening may
be depressed and dashed by a position
suffering from such disabilities could
not concern architects and managers,
for some imagination would be needed
to understand it.</p>
                <p>The new temporary management,
however (whatever the ordinary management
might do), recognising the
rights of the spectator, refrained from
selling any seats from which no view
whatever could be obtained and behaved
very well about it—as perhaps one has
to do when half-a-guinea is charged for
each seat; but with the border-line
seats which they did sell—those on the
confines of the possible area—- a view
of the stage was only partial and so
much a matter of touch-and-go that any
undue craning of the neck or moving
of the head sideways at once interrupted
the line of vision of many worthy folk
at the back; while anyone leaning too
far forward from a seat in the front
row could instantly, for many others,
obliterate the whole stage.</p>
                <p>It happened that on a certain very
hot night in July a fat lady in one of
the front seats not only leaned forward
but fanned herself intermittently with
a large fan.</p>
                <p>Now and then one of the unfortunate
half-guinea seat-holders behind her in
the debatable territory remonstrated
gently and politely, remarking on the
privation her fan was causing to others,
and each time the lady smiled and said
she was very sorry and put the fan
down; but in two minutes she was
fluttering it again as hard as ever, and
not a vestige of the Pentateuchal caperings
or whatever was going forward
could be discerned in her vicinity.</p>
                <p>She meant well, poor lady; but it
was very hot, and how could she help
it when her fan was made of that particular
ostrich's feathers?</p>

                <head>MY TROUSSEAU.</head>
                <p>Having been a bachelor from my
earliest youth I suppose I ought to be
accustomed to the condition; but the
fact remains that I miss something—something
which only a wedding
supplies.</p>
                <p>Curiously enough this want is not a
wife. I have been without one so long
that I should not know what to do
with her if I had one. I should probably
overlook her, and she would become
atrophied or die of neglect or
thirst. Neither do I crave a home of
my own; nor golden-haired children to
climb up my knee. I can do without
these accessories.</p>
                <p>But what I do hunger for and what
I <hi rend="it">will</hi> have is a trousseau. Why the
acquisition of a trousseau should be a
purely feminine prerogative
I have never been able to
understand. A bride without
a trousseau is generally
regarded as an incomplete
thing—a poached-egg without
toast; a salad without
dressing. But the bridegroom
without a trousseau
is a recognised institution.
True, he has new clothes,
both seen and unseen, but
this is not a trousseau; it is
merely a "replenishment of
his wardrobe." His least
disreputable old things are
"made to do"; and nobody
thinks slightingly of him
if he attends his wedding
in a re-cuffed shirt or in
boots that have been resoled.
A girl, however,
would as soon think of
entering Paradise with a second-hand
halo as she would contemplate being
married in anything that was not
aggressively new.</p>
                <p>Thus it is that before my wish can
be consummated I have two honoured
conventions to defy: that only a girl
may possess a trousseau, and that a
marriage is a necessary condition to
the acquiring of it. Fortunately I
am strong-minded. A long course of
Mrs. <name rend="sc">Humphry Ward's</name> homilies has
given me no little facility in achieving
this attribute, and I am determined
that I will change neither my sex nor
my status.</p>
                <p>Now, I have prepared a list, just as—I
suppose—every girl does. In the
first place I am going to indulge in
the hitherto undreamt-of luxury of a
surfeit of dress-shirts. No one who
has not experienced life on two dress-shirts—one
in wear, the other in the
wash—can quite understand what this
will mean to me. Men like Sir <name rend="sc">Joseph
Beecham</name>, Mr. <name rend="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</name>, Mr.
<name rend="sc">Solly Joel</name>, Lord <name rend="sc">Howard de Walden</name>,
and others, who, I daresay, have four
or even five, cannot know what it is
to feel that their evening's refreshment
and entertainment depend on
their finding the French chalk or the
india-rubber.</p>
                <p>Therefore I am making no stint in
this matter. I am having fifteen dress-shirts,
so that there may be one for
wear each day in the week, seven in
the laundry, and one over for emergencies—like
<title>Parsifal</title>, that begins
in the middle of the afternoon. I mean
to be similarly lavish in the matter of
collars and handkerchiefs. The number
of the former which I am buying
amounts almost to an epidemic; while
the extent of my commission in the
latter is the result of lessons learnt in
the hard school of experience. I say
unhesitatingly that the man who tries
to get through life on a mere dozen
handkerchiefs is simply begging for
disaster, as, however methodical in
their use he may be, a carelessly-caught
cold may any day upset his reckoning
and leave him at a loose end; sometimes
scarcely that. Hence I am doing
this part of my trousseau in princely
fashion. I am having half a gross of
them.</p>
                <p>Then there is my slumber-wear. For
years I have hungered for silk ones,
but have had no conscientious excuse
for appeasing my appetite. To buy silk
pyjamas in cold blood has hitherto
seemed to me to be sheer cynical extravagance;
but now I feel that circumstances
justify me in my action,
for it would be a very sorry thing for
me to encounter a burglar or cope with
a fire clad in apparel that would not
be up to the standard of the rest of my
wardrobe.</p>
                <p>Now, I am a great believer in dressing
for the spirit of the moment; therefore
I have resolved upon a pretty colour-scheme
for my night-wear. My pyjamas
are to be of tints conducive to refreshing
rest, namely and severally white,
lemon, light pink, and pale green—an
idea which I candidly confess was inspired
by the spectacle of a Neapolitan
ice. If you think that this is merely
an idle whim, just imagine endeavouring
to sleep in pyjamas patterned like
an Axminster carpet or a Scotch tartan.
No wonder <title>Macbeth</title> "murdered sleep"
if he was arrayed in garments of his
club-colours!</p>
                <p>I have brought the same æsthetic
sense to bear upon my choice of ties
and socks: greys and blacks for times
of grave political crises; fawn, buff,
pearl, moose—I am not sure that this
is a colour, but it sounds
quite possible—for brighter
hours; and colours familiar
to every student of spectroscopy
for halcyon days of
rejoicing—the opening of
the Royal Academy, the
Handel Festival, the return
of <name rend="sc">Harry Lauder</name>, or the
elevation of Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard
Shaw</name> to the peerage.</p>
                <p>As for externals, suffice
it to say that they will be
<title>en suite</title>, and that I intend
to introduce just a little
touch of originality into my
trousers. I am going to
have them made with spats
sewn to the leg-ends in
order to save time and
trouble in dressing.</p>
                <p>In short, I have forgotten
nothing, except spare studs,
and I think it is quite likely that
I shall remember them too in course
of time. I have even gone so far as
to fix a day for a dress rehearsal.
But first I shall invite my friends,
as is the way with brides-elect, to a
private view of my trousseau, when
they shall see all of it spread upon the
coverlet of my bed, over the backs of
my chairs, or hanging in serried ranks
in my wardrobe.</p>
                <p>And now nothing more remains
to be done but to raise the necessary
funds, and with this object in view
I have instructed my broker to draw
my money out of the Savings Bank.
I am expecting a postal-order almost
any moment.</p>

                    <title>Sir Frank.</title> My dear Violet—— (A
report is heard and a splintering of
glass.) Confound it all, I'm shot!
(Falls on floor.)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> Yes, he certainly appears to
be shot. I'd better go and see the
police about it.(Goes out.)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Reggie Fortescue (entering precipitately</title>).
Violet.... (Looking round
in perplexity). Not here! She said
she would be here.... She is false
to me. False! I have nothing left to
live for.
(Takes out a revolver, shoots
himself and falls on the floor.)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald Maristowe (entering cautiously
through the window and carrying a rifle</title>).
This is a devil of a risky business, this
rifle practice, but Ulster must be saved
somehow. I see I've broken the window.
Wonder if I've done any other
damage. (<title>Sees</title> Sir Frank.) Gee! I've
killed a man! (<title>Sees</title> Reggie.) Oh, glory!
I've killed two of 'em! Reggie, too,
by all that's rum! I say, you know,
that's pretty useful shooting.... Still,
it probably means hanging, and I'm—er—hanged
if I'll be hanged. Let me
rather die by my own hand. (<title>Discharges
rifle at himself, and falls on floor.</title>)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet</title> (<title>re-entering with an Inspector
and a Constable</title>). There he is, Inspector.
(<title>Sees</title> Gerald.) My goodness, there seem
to be two now! I feel sure.... (<title>Sees</title>
Reggie.) <title>Three!</title> Really, Inspector, I
feel almost certain that when I left....
Oh, it's Reggie! My heart is broken!
(<title>Faints.</title>)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Stand back, Clarkson; this
job requires thought. (<title>Takes up telephone
receiver.</title>) Circus 20634, Miss....
That you Doc.? Come round at once,
please.... Two or three men shot....
Right.... (<title>Hangs up receiver.</title>)
Clarkson, measure the exact distance
between each corpse and the window.
(Clarkson <title>proceeds to do so</title>. <title>Enter</title>
Doctor.) Ah, Doc., that's the little job
I mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Doctor</title> (<title>kneeling by</title> Violet). This one
isn't shot; she's only fainted. She'll
be all right in a minute. (<title>Examines</title>
Gerald.) Nor is this one. <title>He</title>'ll be all
right in a minute. (<title>Examines</title> Reggie.)
Nor is this one. <title>He'</title>ll be all right in
a minute. (<title>Examines</title> Sir Frank.) This
one is, though. Dead as a door-nail.
(Violet, Reggie <hi rend="it">and</hi> Gerald <title>rise simultaneously
to their feet</title>.) There you are!
I told you so.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). Missed!</p>

                    <title>Reggie</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). Missed! (<title>Aloud</title>)
Violet, I love you!</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> I'm <hi rend="it">so</hi> glad, because I love
you.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Reggie</title> (<hi rend="it">confidentially</hi>). Do you know,
I really thought I was dead. Hello.
Gerald, old son, what are you doing
here?</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald.</title> Oh, I thought I'd sort of
look in, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Violet Hazelwood, I arrest
you for the murder of Sir Frank
Bulkeley, Bart., and I warn you that
anything you may say will be used in
evidence against you. Clarkson, stop
playing with that tape and handcuff the
prisoner. (Clarkson <title>does so</title>.)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). Good business! That
saves <hi rend="it">my</hi> neck.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> But, my dear good soul....
However, I suppose it's no use to say
anything. Reggie, I can never marry
you now.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Reggie.</title> You couldn't in any case, my
dear, because I haven't got any money.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> You forget that you are sole
heir to Sir Frank there, who had fourteen
thousand a year. <title>I</title> thought of
that at once.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Reggie.</title> Columbus! So I am. Well,
that <hi rend="it">is</hi> a dashed nuisance.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald</title> (<title>coming forward nobly</title>). My
dear, dear friends, I cannot allow your
happiness to be wrecked in this way.
I killed Sir Frank! You can be married
now.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Reggie.</title> Good egg! (<title>Embraces</title> Violet.)</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Gerald Maristowe, I arrest
you for the murder of Sir Frank
Bulkeley, Bart., and I warn you that
anything you may say will be used in
evidence against you.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> Oh, we must save him. What
can we do?</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson.</title> Lady, do you remember
years ago giving sixpence to a starving
boy in Peckham Rye?</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson.</title>
                    <title>I</title> am—that is, <hi rend="it">was</hi>—that
boy. I will save your friend. Inspector,
you know that a reward of
£10,000 is offered for the capture of
the anarchist Mazzio?</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Yes. I wish to heaven
I could lay my hands on him.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson.</title> I can tell you how to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> How?</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson</title> (<title>dramatically tearing off his
wig and false moustache</title>). I am Mazzio!
(<title>Turning to</title> Gerald <title>and the others</title>) I
shall struggle violently. While he is
engaged in arresting me, you can make
good your escape.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Ha! Do you think I can
be so easily baffled? (<title>Picking up telephone
receiver.</title>) There are other police
in the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Violet.</title> Not so. (<title>Slashes through the
telephone cord with a knife</title>).</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald.</title> Bravo!</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Oh, well, never mind.
(Puts his head out of the window and
blows a police whistle. The others look
at one another in consternation.) Now
I think I am master of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson.</title> Foiled! All the same, you
are less fortunate than you imagine.
When I said I was Mazzio, I lied.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Prove it.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson.</title> Easily. Mazzio has a scar
on his left forearm. (<title>Rolling up sleeve</title>)
I have none.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector.</title> Oh, well, never mind. I
can now proceed with the arrest of the
murderer of Sir Frank Bulkeley, Bart.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). I'm done for!</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Clarkson.</title> There <hi rend="it">must</hi> be some way
of escape. Doc., it's up to you to do
something.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Doctor.</title> With pleasure. I certify that
Sir Frank died from heart disease.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Inspector</title> (<hi rend="it">stammering</hi>). But—but—but
he's <hi rend="it">obviously</hi> shot. I mean to
say——</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Doctor.</title> I certify that Sir Frank
Bulkeley died from heart disease ten
seconds before the bullet struck him
You can do nothing in the face of my
certificate.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Gerald, Reggie and Violet.</title> Saved!</p>

                <head>THE PUNCHER'S GRIEVANCE.</head>
                <p>"You journalist chaps just spoil us,"
said Puncher Pete, when I called upon
him yesterday at his training camp.
"You draw us into conversation, stick
down our remarks in your note-books,
and then make us out to be the biggest
boasters on the face of the earth. It's
not right.</p>
                <p>"For instance, you've got it on the
tip of your tongue to ask me if I think
I'll lick Jimmy Battle next Thursday.
Well, of course I'll lick him. Jimmy's
a good boy, but he can't stay, and then
<hi rend="it">he</hi> hasn't gone twenty rounds with
three blacks, as I have. But what's
my opinion matter to you? Why
make me shout it out like a cock on
a steeple?</p>
                <p>"Yes, I shall beat Jimmy. Six
rounds will cure him. All right. Very
well then. Leave it at that.</p>
                <p>"One of your fellows called upon me
two days ago. 'Pete,' he said, 'they
say you're ill.' 'You tell 'em to mind
their own ills,' I gave him back. Ill,
indeed! If I were ill could I walk my
forty miles a day and think nothing of
it?" Could I lift Harry Blokes there
with one hand and hold him above my
head? D'you suppose a sick man
could do <hi rend="it">this</hi>?"</p>
                <p>The Puncher seized a skipping-rope
and did marvellous things with it.
Then he smashed lustily at a punch-ball,
left, right, left, right, duck, bing!
"Here, Harry!" he cried. His sparring
partner approached, bruised but
beaming. The Puncher knocked him
down.</p>
                <p>"I seem ill, don't I?" said Pete,
turning to me. "But what's it got to
do with all you chaps, anyway? Wait
till Thursday. Then you'll find out
whether I'm ill or not. And even if I
was ill Jimmy couldn't do it. Jimmy's
got as good a punch as the next man.
I'll say that for him. If he gets it in
it would foil an ox. But can he get it
in? Not next Thursday.</p>
                <p>"Now, see here, you're not going to
draw any words from me about the
coming fight. You may draw others.
I refuse. Let's get right off this fight
and on to other things.</p>
                <p>"After all, fighters are modest chaps.
When I knocked Torpedo Troop out
in three rounds last April for a purse
of £5,000 and the Championship of
Nova Scotia I didn't go bragging. I
might have said that this was the first
time that the Torpedo had ever had
his eyes closed. Well, I didn't. What's
more, I never shall. Tell your reader
that!</p>
                <p>"Take my victory over Quartermain,
again. Or over Dinghy Abbs, who was
down and out in the second round in
spite of all the fuss that was made about
him beforehand. I was a sick man at
both these fights. Not a soul knew it,
mind you. My wife—for I'm as fond
of home life as any ordinary man, and
we have a little baby—my wife used to
worry terribly. She'd expect me to
come home on a stretcher. But I
never happened to choose that conveyance,
and she don't fret any more.</p>
                <p>"Will it be a stretcher on Thursday?
I can see you want to put that question,
but I'll ask you to excuse me. Next
Thursday, as I've already hinted, will
tell its own story, and when I say that
the tale will have a happy ending for
one of us who isn't too far from your
ear to boast about it if he was inclined
that way, perhaps you'll guess without
my telling you what I mean.</p>
                <p>"Not at all, Sir. Don't mention it.
I'm always glad to have a friendly chat
with anyone, and I hope you'll forgive
me for refusing to talk shop."</p>

                <p>
                    <title>House of Lords, Monday, July
13.</title>—<name rend="sc">Camperdown</name>, like <name rend="sc">Habakkuk</name>,
is <title>capable de tout</title>. Can do
(is at least ready to undertake)
anything. Like Lord <name rend="sc">John
Russell</name>, he would at an hour's
notice take charge of the British
fleet, whether in Home waters
or on Foreign stations. Confesses
with pathetic modesty
that there are two things beyond
his capacity. One is to find a
needle in a pottle of hay; the
other, to discover a teller in
Division Lobby when no one
proposes to tell.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>To-night this last dilemma
faced noble earl. Home Rule
Amendment Bill before House
in Report stage. <name rend="sc">Macdonell</name>
moved amendment introducing
principle of proportional representation.
After long debate
Question put from Woolsack. There
being a few cries of "Not content!"
House cleared for division.</p>
                <p>Hereupon strange thing happened.
Whilst majority of peers streamed into
Content Lobby discovery was made that
not only were there no tellers for the
Not-Contents but no Not-Contents for
the tellers. Fortunately <name rend="sc">Camperdown</name>
on the spot. Instantly took charge of
the affair. According to his own
narrative, which thrilled the
listening Senate, he had gone
into Division Lobby, "where,"
he added, "I stayed a long time."</p>
                <p>Began to realise something of
the feeling of the boy who stood
on the burning deck whence all
but he had fled. <name rend="sc">Camperdown</name>
essentially a man of action.
No use mooning round deserted
Lobby wondering where everybody
was.</p>
                <p>"I tried," he protested, "to
find a teller for the Not-Contents,
which I was not able to do.
There were no Not-Contents in
the Not-Contents' Lobby and
there were no tellers. I do not
know," he added, turning his
head with enquiring pose, like
<title>Mr. Pecksniff</title> asking his pupil
<title>Martin Chuzzlewit</title> to take compass,
pencil and paper, and "give
me your idea of a wooden leg,"
"whether any of your lordships
have seen an occurrence like
this before. I have not."</p>
                <p>Murmur of sympathy ran
round perturbed benches. Dilemma
awful, unprecedented,
irretrievable. But everyone felt that
<name rend="sc">Camperdown</name> had done his duty, and
that if he had failed to find Not-Contents
in an empty Lobby no one else
could have found them.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Business done.</title>—In House of Commons
<name rend="sc">Premier</name> announced winding-up
of business at earliest possible moment
with intent to meet again in
"early winter" for new Session. No
Autumn Session, you'll observe.
Feeling against it so strong that
insistence might have broken
bonds that link faithful Ministerialists
with their esteemed
Leader. Accordingly prorogation
about usual time in
August, and new Session, instead
of opening in February,
will date from November. When
we come to think of it, seems
to amount to much the same
thing as Autumn Session, which
usually begins in mid-October.
That an illusion. There will be
no Autumn Session. Only we
shall all be back at Westminster
again in drear November.</p>

                    <title>House of Commons, Tuesday.</title>—Like
<name rend="sc">Rachel</name> weeping for her
children, the Opposition will not
be comforted in respect of the
continued absence of <name rend="sc">Chancellor</name>
of the Duchy. 'Tis a touching
trait, illustrating the high
level of human nature the
Commons reach. Had it been
<name rend="sc">Masterman's</name> political friends
who mourned his absence, recognising
in it cause of insecurity for the Empire,
situation would be natural and comprehensible.
It is from the so-labelled
enemy's camp that lamentation is
sounded. <name rend="sc">Worthington Evans, Masterman's</name>
severest censor whilst he still
sat on Treasury Bench in charge of
Insurance Act, is in especial degree inconsolable.
Physically and intellectually
reduced to a pulp—using
the word of course in Parliamentary
sense.</p>
                <p>As he is too unnerved to
dwell upon subject, <name rend="sc">Barnston</name>
and <name rend="sc">Hayes Fisher</name> to-day take
it up. Want to know how long
a state of things most painful
on their side of the House is
to continue? <name rend="sc">Premier</name> makes
light reply. Points out that
it's no new thing for a Minister
to fail to find a seat, the globe
meanwhile serenely revolving
on its axis. In 1885 and in 1892
the Duchy was unrepresented on
the Treasury Bench.</p>
                <p>A more striking case, overlooked
by <name rend="sc">Premier</name>, of a Minister
long struggling with adversity
at the poll finding the
door of House of Commons
bolted and barred is familiar to
Lord <name rend="sc">Halsbury</name>. Appointed
Solicitor-General in 1875 <name rend="sc">Hardinge
Giffard</name> did not take his
seat till the Session of 1877.
Crushed at Cardiff, left in the
lurch at Launceston, hustled at
Horsham, named as a probable
starter at every election race<pb xml:id="Page_94" n="Pg 94"/>
in the three kingdoms taking place
within a period of eighteen months,
he persuaded the blushing borough of
Launceston, on a second wooing, to
yield to his advances.</p>
                <p>Oddly enough, when at last he came
to the Table to take the oath, he found
he had mislaid the return to the writ,
production of which is indispensable
preliminary. Was nearly turned back,
a calamity averted by discovery of the
document in his hat on a bench
under the Gallery where he had
awaited <name rend="sc">Speaker's</name> summons to
the Table.</p>
                <p>But precedents are nothing when
the bosom is deeply stirred.</p>
                <p>"Can't the <name rend="sc">Chancellor</name> of the
Duchy make an effort to secure a
seat?" <name rend="sc">Barnston</name> asked in tremulous
voice.</p>
                <p>"He has made two already,"
retorted the practical <name rend="sc">Premier</name>.</p>
                <p>Then came along <name rend="sc">Watt</name>, with
cryptic inquiry breaking silence
that brooded over Ministerial
benches.</p>
                <p>"Has the time not arrived," he
asked, "to jettison <name rend="sc">Jonah</name>, in view
of the fact that nobody seems
willing to swallow him but the
whale?"</p>
                <p>House left thinking the matter
over.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Business done.</title>—House of Lords
passed Third Reading of transformed
Home Rule Amendment
Bill. In the Commons Budget Bill
again dealt with in Committee.
Sharp strictures from both sides.
But Ministerialists who had come
to criticise remained to vote in its
favour. Majority accordingly maintained
at normal level.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Wednesday.</title>—<name rend="sc">Son Austen</name>, who
little more than a fortnight ago left
the House Member for East Worcester,
returned to-day representing
the division of Birmingham where
his father sat impregnably throned
for uninterrupted period of twenty-nine
years. As he walked up to
Table to take the oath and sign afresh
the roll of Parliament, was hailed by
hearty burst of general cheering.</p>
                <p>This rare. Common enough for one
or other political party to welcome
recruit to its ranks. On such occasions,
the other side sit silent, save when
especial circumstances elicit responsive
bout of ironical cheering. To-day's
demonstration afforded striking recognition
of genuine merit modestly displayed.</p>
                <p>Ever a difficult thing for young
Member to be son of distinguished
father also seated in the House. Position
to be sustained only by exercise
of qualities of mind and manner
rarely combined. Whilst his father
yet enthralled attention and admiration
of House by supreme capacity
<name rend="sc">Son Austen</name> successfully faced the
ordeal. After <name rend="sc">Don José's</name> withdrawal
from the scene his son's advance to a
leading place in the councils of his
party and the estimation of the House
was rapid. Within limits of present
Session he has shown increased power
as a debater, promising attainment of
still loftier heights. Ever courteous in
manner, untainted by the "new style"
deplored by <name rend="sc">Premier</name>, he, though an
uncompromising party man, has made
no personal enemies among any section
of his political opponents.</p>

                    <title>Business done.</title>—House of Lords
threw out Plural Voters Bill on second
time of asking. Commons still in Committee

                <head>EXERCISE 1.</head>
                <p>I must confess that at one time I
had little regard for collectors of
cigarette cards; it seemed a feeble
pursuit, though perhaps I should add
I am of a somewhat intellectual nature.

Some little time ago, however, I
happened to glance at one of these
cards and was surprised to see a picture
of a gentleman attired in white flannels
and a vest of white, decorated with red
embroidery. He was grasping a towel
in both hands and appeared to have
two or three sets of arms. The label
said, "Scarf or Towel Exercises 4." A
perusal of the instructions on the back
of the card made everything clear.</p>
                <p>Ten minutes later I entered the shop
of an athletic outfitter. Unfortunately
he had no white vests with red edges:
I had to purchase one with blue. A
scarf or towel I could find at home.</p>
                <p>Then I entered a tobacconist's.</p>
                <p>Four days later I had collected Scarf
or Towel Exercises 2 and 3.</p>
                <p>"We can," I said, "now make a
start." As a matter of fact it was not
altogether a foolish proceeding. Deep
thinkers are apt to overlook the need
for physical culture. This error I
decided to remedy.</p>
                <p>Every morning I (1) stood in position
illustrated, (2) raised arms above
head in manner indicated by the instructions,
(3) straightened right arm
and lowered right hand so that towel
(<title>still taut</title>) sloped to right, (4) returned
to Position 1. I then changed towel
for scarf (my own idea) and continued
with Exercises 3 and 4.</p>
                <p>I was very happy; my only worry
was the absence of Scarf or Towel
Exercises 1.</p>
                <p>Every morning I called at the
tobacconist's and purchased packets of
cigarettes, eagerly searching them for
the missing card. Every afternoon I
called again.</p>
                <p>For a week I bore my disappointment
bravely; then I became cynical.</p>
                <p>"Perhaps," I said, "there is no
Exercise 1. It may be a joke on the
part of the makers."</p>
                <p>My consumption of cigarettes increased.
Packet followed packet with
extraordinary rapidity, and still no
Exercise 1.</p>
                <p>I began to get worried. "Is it safe."
I asked myself, "to do 2, 3 and 4 without
1? The omission may have a
serious effect on 2, 3 and 4."</p>
                <p>Then I returned to the attack with
renewed vigour. In a week I got
through twenty tens—with no result.</p>
                <p>Disappointed and weary I was walking
to the office one morning when
suddenly I had an attack of giddiness.
By the end of the day I was beginning
to wonder if I was very ill. I felt it.
Usually the clearest of thinkers, I was
dizzy and dazed.</p>
                <p>The evening saw the arrival of my
doctor, and a thorough examination
followed, at the end of which he shook
his head gravely.</p>
                <p>"'M," he murmured. "Ah."</p>
                <p>"Tell me," I said with extraordinary
calmness—"tell me the worst. Brain
fever, I suppose?"</p>
                <p>"Oh, dear no," he replied. "What
I'm worrying about is the heart. It's
in a bad state-a really bad state.
Heaven knows how many cigarettes
you've been consuming lately. You'll
have to stop it altogether."</p>
                <p>I looked at him blankly; then, with
a bitter laugh, I (1) stood in position
illustrated, (2) raised arms above head
in manner indicated by the instructions,
(3) straightened right arm and
lowered right hand so that handkerchief
(<title>still taut</title>) sloped to right, and
(4) returned to sofa.</p>

                <p>This is not, like the plays in which
<name rend="sc">Joseph</name> has recently figured, an adaptation
from the Hebrew. Mr. <name rend="sc">Stephen
Phillips</name> has given a seventeenth-century
(<name rend="sc">A.D.</name>) setting to the <name rend="sc">Bathsheba</name>
motive, transplanting it from the polygamous
East into the England of one-man-one-wife.
His object, no doubt,
was to emphasize one aspect of his
borrowed theme, which is further enforced
by his choice of <hi rend="it">milieu</hi>—the
camp of the Puritans.</p>
                <p>Lest this fairly obvious note of
irony should escape us, Mr. <name rend="sc">Phillips</name>
accentuates it at the start by making
his <name rend="sc">David</name> (<title>Sir Hubert Lisle</title>, Commander
of the Parliamentary Forces in
the fenland) condemn a young officer
to be shot for a "carnal" offence. The
delinquent's answer—</p>
                <lg>

                        <l>"Thou who so lightly dealest death to me</l>
                        <l>Be thou then very sure of thine own soul;"</l>
                    </lg>
                </lg>
                <p>and <title>Lisle's</title> prayer—</p>
                <lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"And judge me, Thou that sittest in Thy Heaven,</l>
                        <l>As I have shown no mercy, show me none!...</l>
                        <l>If ever a woman's beauty shall ensnare</l>
                        <l>My soul into such sin as he hath sinned"—</l>
                    </lg>
                </lg>
                <p>these passages, even if the title of the
play had not prepared us, afford fair
warning of the way in which things
have got to go. In fact it is all very
simple and straightforward, and (on
the constructive side) Hellenic. Perhaps
indeed the treatment is a little
too direct, and the tragedy moves too
quickly to its consummation (thirty or
forty minutes suffice for the reading of
it). It might serve its publisher (of the
Bodley Head) as one of a series to be
entitled: "Half-hours with the Best
Sinners."</p>
                <p>As a poem <title>The Sin of David</title> cannot
compare for beauty with <title>Paolo and
Francesca</title>, though it contains isolated
lines which recall Mr. <name rend="sc">Phillips's</name>
earliest drama, such as the plea of
<title>Joyce</title>, the condemned officer—</p>
                <lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"Her face was close to me, and dimmed the world."</l>
                    </lg>
                </lg>
                <p>or <title>Lisle's</title>—</p>
                <lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"Thou hast unlocked the loveliness of earth."</l>
                    </lg>
                </lg>
                <p>But then, of course, the exotic manner
would here have been an impropriety.
This is not Rimini; it is the English
Fenland; and all the characters, with
the exception of <title>Miriam Mardyke</title> (the
<name rend="sc">Bathsheba</name> of the piece), who was bred
in France and had its sun in her blood,
were of the Puritan pattern that does
not accommodate itself very easily to
the language of passion.</p>
                <p>But all this we knew ten years ago,
when <title>The Sin of David</title> was first published;
and the only new interest was
the question of its adaptability to the
theatre. Poetic drama seldom gains
much by presentation on the stage,
unless it is full of action; and there is
little action in this play except of the
inward kind. In almost the only case
where quick movement is here demanded
one becomes conscious of the intrusion
of words. When he knows that the
relief of Pomfret depends upon his instant
action, <title>Lisle</title> still finds time for
conversations with his servant, with
<title>Miriam</title> and with the doctor, and for
a couple of well-sustained soliloquies.</p>
                <p>Certain lines, again, whose literary
flavour, when read, makes us overlook
their inherent improbability in the
mouth of the character that utters
them, take on, when spoken, an air of
artifice. Such are the lines in which
<title>Miriam</title> describes her old sister-in-law,
to her face, as</p>
                <lg>
                    <l rend="i4">"living without sin</l>
                    <l>And reputably rusting to the grave."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>And there is always the danger that
actors will be content with a rather
slurred and perfunctory recitation of
lines that have no bearing on the
action but are just inserted for joy as
a rhetorical embroidery.</p>
                <p>It may be a trivial criticism, but I
think the play suffered a little from the
appearance of the love-child whose
death was to be the punishment for
<title>Lisle's</title> sin in sending <title>Mardyke</title> to his
death in a forlorn hope. The instructions
in my book are contradictory.
The time of Act III. is described as
"five years later," and we are then told
that "four years are supposed to have
elapsed since Act II." Anyhow, the boy
should be only three or four years old.
Actually he is a girl (the stage must
have it so) of some ten summers. You
may say that all those years during
which the lovers' passion has been
purified by worship of the child's innocence,
and "God has not said a word,"
add a dramatic force to the blow when
at last it falls. But for myself—a mere
matter of taste—I feel that the vengeance
of Heaven has been nursed too
long.</p>
                <p>As for the interpretation, I must
honestly compliment Mr. <name rend="sc">Irving</name> and
Miss <name rend="sc">Miriam Lewes</name> on their performance.
It is true that I should never
have mistaken Mr. <name rend="sc">Irving</name> for a fighting
Roundhead, and he might well have
sacrificed something of his personality
for the sake of illusion. It is true, too,
that he was more concerned about
dramatic than poetic effects; yet, within
the limitations of a very marked individuality,
he did justice to the author by a
performance that was most sincere and
persuasive. Miss <name rend="sc">Lewis</name> played her
more difficult part with great charm
and delicacy. Her manner, even under
stress of passionate feeling, still kept the
right restraint that <title>Miriam</title> had learnt
from her environment; but always we
were made to feel that under the prim
Puritan gown was a body that had
been "born in the sun's lap," and held
the warmth of the vinelands in its veins.
Perhaps it was from France, too, that
<title>Miriam</title> had caught her strange habit
of pronouncing "my" (a perfectly good
word) as "me."</p>
                <p>There is little so worth seeing on the
stage to-day as <title>The Sin of David</title>, and
I very sincerely hope that both the
play and its interpreters may win the
wide appreciation they have earned.</p>

                    <p>"Very well," said the lady of the house, "don't let's do it.
Nobody can force us to go to the seaside if we don't want to."</p>
                    <p>"It's too late," I said, "to begin to agree with me now."</p>
                    <p>"It's never too late to realise how reasonable you are."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, it is. The agreement is signed; half the rent has
been paid; Sandstone House has got us by the legs, and,
whether we like it or not, we've got to go there next week."</p>
                    <p>"We might try the effect of a death-bed repentance."</p>
                    <p>"No," I said, "we're dead already. We died when
the blessed agreement was signed."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, let's write and say our aunt from British
Columbia is about to arrive here unexpectedly on a visit to
us, and that sand and seaweed and prawns and star-fish are
simply death to her. We can wind up with a strong appeal
to the landlord's better nature. No true landlord can
wish to be responsible for the death of anybody's British
Columbian aunt."</p>
                    <p>"You're quite wrong," I said. "Landlords just revel in
that kind of thing. Besides, he will not believe in our
aunt. He will say that she is too thin."</p>
                    <p>"But the aunt I'm thinking of is stout and wheezy.
She is a widow; her name is Aunt Wilhelmina; except
ourselves there's nobody in the world left for her to cling
to. No marine landlord can dare to separate us from Aunt
Wilhelmina."</p>
                    <p>"It's no good," I said. "I'll admit that your Aunt
Wilhelmina——"</p>
                    <p>"She's only mine by marriage, you know; but I love
her like a daughter."</p>
                    <p>"I admit," I continued, "that Aunt-by-marriage Wilhelmina
may some day be useful to us. We will put her by
for another occasion. But she can't help us now."</p>
                    <p>"Well, go ahead yourself and suggest something, then."</p>
                    <p>"I could suggest a thousand things. Suppose we just
pay the rest of the rent and don't go."</p>
                    <p>"The man," she said with conviction, "is mad."</p>
                    <p>"I thought you'd say that, and I know you'd say the
same about any other suggestion of mine, so I shan't make
any more."</p>
                    <p>"You mustn't be sulky," she said.</p>
                    <p>"I never am. I'm reasonable, but, as usual, you'll
realise it too late. Besides," I added, "it's you who've
brought us into this fix."</p>
                    <p>"I?" she said with an air of wonder, "How can I
have done that?"</p>
                    <p>"I'll tell you," I said firmly, for I saw that my chance
had come. "For weeks and weeks past you have been
engaged in shutting up avenues and closing loop-holes.
Wherever there was the tiniest way of escape from the
seaside, there you were with your walls and your fences,
until at last you'd got me safely penned in."</p>
                    <p>"You didn't struggle much, did you?"</p>
                    <p>"No, I was like the man in <title>The Pit and the Pendulum</title>,
and you were—whoever it was that made the walls close
in on him."</p>
                    <p>"I refuse," she said, "to be called a Spanish Inquisition."</p>
                    <p>"You may refuse as much as you like, but that's the
sort of thing you've been. How you worked on my
domestic affections and my household pride! When Helen
forgot to go to her music-lesson you said the poor child
was evidently run down and wanted a breath of sea-air.
When Rosie lost her German exercise-book, and when
Peggy fell off her bicycle, you worked both these accidents
round into an imperative demand for salt water. When
John was bitten by a gnat you said the spot was bilious
and things would never be right with him until he got into
a more bracing climate; and when Bates tripped up in the
pantry and broke a week's income in plates and dishes you
said he needed tone and would get it at the sea. Seaside,
seaside, seaside! I couldn't got away from it."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, but you haven't been there yet, you know. You're
shouting before you're hurt."</p>
                    <p>"No," I said, "I am not—I mean I am hurt, but I'm
not shouting. I'm just whispering a few salutary truths."</p>
                    <p>"And there's another thing," she said; "it must be terrible
for you to know what a designing person your wife is."</p>
                    <p>"Madam," I said, "my wife is as heaven made her. I
will not permit her to be abused. She has good impulses.
She means well. Her plain sewing is quite excellent."</p>
                    <p>"Spare me," who said, "oh spare me. I will never go to
the sea again."</p>
                    <p>"But you <hi rend="it">shall</hi> go to the sea," I said. "Everything is
settled. The agreement is signed; the tickets are all but
taken. John and Peggy are panting for pails and spades.
Do you think I want to stand in the way of their innocent
pleasures? We will all try for shrimps while you sit on a
heap of sand and tell us not to get too wet, or that it's
time for tea, and have I forgotten the thermos-flask again."</p>
                    <p>"Horatio," she said, "I can see you paddling in my
mind's eye."</p>
                    <p>"But tell me," I said, "when do we start."</p>
                    <p>"We start on Tuesday. The whole lot of us together,
you know, servants and all. Won't that be fun?"</p>
                    <p>"Ye—es," I said, "it will—I mean it would if I could
go with you, but unfortunately——"</p>
                    <p>"<title>What!</title>" she said, "you mean to desert us?"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I can never desert you, but I've got two
solemn engagements on Tuesday—meetings in the City."</p>
                    <p>"Then I'm to take the whole party, am I?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, dear," I said. "And I'll join you next day."</p>
                    <p>"You've won," she said.</p>

                    <head>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</head>
                    <p rend="center">(<title>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</title>)</p>
                    <p>If memory serves me, the publishers of <title>World's End</title>
(<name rend="sc">Hurst and Blackett</name>) described its theme as one of
unusual delicacy, or words to that effect. I should like to
reassure them. The particular kind of marriage of convenience
which it concerns (marriage for the convenience of
the wronged heroine, by which the virtuous hero gives his
name to the child of the villain) may be, indeed is, a delicate
matter, but—in fiction at least—by no manner of means
unusual. Nor can I see that its present treatment by
<name rend="sc">Amèlie Rives</name> (Princess <name rend="sc">Troubetzkoy</name>) lends it any degree
of novelty. No, let me be just; perhaps <title>Richard Bryce</title>, the
wicked betrayer, does strike a somewhat new note, at least
in his beginnings. <title>Richard</title> was the product of art superimposed
upon dollars. He was so cultured that the
humanity in him had dwindled to a negligible quantity;
and thus, when poor <title>Phoebe</title> wanted him to "do the right
thing by her," he sent her instead some charmingly modern
French verse—which she could not understand—and finally
took ship for Europe in mingled alarm and boredom. You
will have gathered that the scene is laid in America.
Perhaps this explains the hero. <title>Owen Randolph</title> was one
of the strong and silent. He was so silent that, though he
knew perfectly well all that had happened, he married
<title>Phoebe</title>, and allowed that unhappy lady to suffer chapters
of agonized apprehension as to his attitude, when half-a-dozen
words would have set her at ease on the subject.
He was, moreover, so strong that, when eventually the
theme of their relations with <title>Phoebe</title> did crop up between
himself and <title>Richard</title>, the latter spent some months in
hospital as a consequence. However, he recovered, and
things were thus able to reach the kind of ending which
was expected of them. There are parts of <title>World's End</title>
that are worthy of a better whole, but that is the best I can
say for it.</p>
                    <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
                    <p>I believe that <title>Paul Moorhouse</title> (<name rend="sc">Long</name>) was never really
predestined to end unhappily and that his suicide was a
conclusion as little premeditated by the author as it was
apparently by the hero. If such ends must be, they should
be a climax demanded by relentless logic: some sort of
culminating event should occur which, added to what has
gone before, leaves no alternative. <title>Paul</title>, however, had
survived for years under the stress of all the circumstances
which finally constrained him to make an end of himself;
and, had he stayed the course—only another hour or so—he
would have found that all had turned out for the best and
that adequate arrangements had been made for his permanent
happiness. No doubt these things happen in real life
and I cannot accuse Mr. <name rend="sc">George Wouil</name> (a most
discerning
author) of any inhuman treatment of his puppet; yet I
wish that he had been more kindly disposed and had spared
me a bitter disappointment. Having known <title>Paul</title>, man
and boy, for upwards of ten years, I had become sincerely
attached to him; as assistant time-keeper, foreman and
works-manager he showed a spirit true to the real Black
Country type. He had his moments of weakness when he
went astray after the manner of his kind; but he always
became master of himself again and, when he had to, paid
like a man the price of his misdeeds, never pausing to discover<pb xml:id="Page_100" n="Pg 100"/>
the overcharge. As for <title>Joan Ware</title>, his intended and
his due, she was a dear; poor dear!</p>
                    <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
                    <p>I do not think that you will believe <title>The Story of Fifine</title>
(<name rend="sc">Constable</name>), although Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard Capes</name> takes some
pains to give it an air of actuality; but if you are like me
you will not be greatly concerned about that. Purporting
to be the ill-used daughter of a mad French marquis,
<title>Fifine</title>, in that <title>naïve</title> and charming way which has always
been so dear to the hearts of novelists, came to live at the
bachelor abode in Paris of the sculptor <title>Felix Dane</title> (his half-sister,
who was keeping house for the marquis, provided
the introduction), and, calling each other "cousin" and
"gossip," these two shared rooms together in perfect simplicity
of soul and held several conversations which reflect.
I suppose, Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard Capes'</name> views on the plastic arts
and life in general. And why, in passing, he should continue
to heap ridicule on staid Victorian respectability I
cannot for the life of me imagine. The plucky and unorthodox
thing nowadays
surely is to make game
of Bohemianism. But,
anyhow, the happy moment
for me arrived when
<title>Felix Dane</title> suggested (on
the grounds that the
marquis would soon discover
his daughter's hiding-place)
a holiday tour
through Provence. Mr.
<name rend="sc">Bernard Capes</name> in Provence
is Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard
Capes</name> at his best. How
the lovers (for that—perhaps
you roguishly
guessed it?—they gradually
became) paid visits
to Nîmes, to Aigues-Mortes,
to Arles and to
Paradou les Baux, and
met <title>M. Carabas Cabarus</title>,
the native minstrel, you
must read for yourself,
for I cannot give a faint
idea of the eloquence with
which their fairyland is portrayed. And if the plot ends as
artificially as it began, and with an unnecessary tragedy
thrown in, I suppose for the sake of that idyll in the very
nesting-place of idylls I must shrug my shoulders and forgive.
After all, it does not matter much who <title>Fifine</title> really
was, nor what happened to her. Suffice it that Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard
Capes</name> has conducted her to Arles.</p>

                        <title>The Caddis-Worm</title> (<name rend="sc">Hurst and Blackett</name>) is an appropriate
enough title for Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dawson Scott's</name> novel, but I
confess to having grown a little restive at its appearance
on the top of each of 352 pages. "Episodes in the Life of
Richard and Catharine Blake" is the alternative title, and
to the average human reader possibly a more significant
one. <title>The Caddis-Worm</title> is quite in the modern manner,
having no plot—or what has been contemptuously called
"anecdote." I have, however, a more genuine grievance
against Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dawson Scott</name>, and it is that she seems
inclined to be a propagandist without the requisite robustness.
A little more vigour in her protests against the
iniquity of British laws, and her theme might have allured
me. As it is, the troubles of <title>Catharine</title> with her peremptory
<title>Richard</title> only made me want, but not very keenly, to
take and give her a good shaking. Whereas, with a little
more encouragement, I believe I should have been quite
anxious to kick her husband from the top to the bottom of
several flights of stairs. Drastic methods were taken by
the author to bring <title>Richard</title> to his senses; in fact, at one
time he made a sort of corner in disasters. But unless a
sanatorium exists where patients are treated kindly and
firmly for swollen-head I do not think that <title>Richard's</title> cure
is likely to be permanent. That, however, does not affect
my view that Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dawson Scott</name> has given us a book
which is full of clever writing and fairly shrewd observation.</p>

                    <p>"It was a wild wet night, though the month of May was
well begun." Without caring very much about the month
of May, I felt on reading these introductory words that the
story called <title>My Lady Rosia</title> had excellently well begun. I
am sorry to add, though, that it does not carry on quite so
bravely as you might expect from such a start. My own
suspicion is that <title>Lady Rosia</title> is one of many novels that
owe their existence to a summer holiday. I haven't the
slightest knowledge of
the facts, and still less
wish to incur a libel
action, but, by my way
of imagining it, Miss
<name rend="sc">Freda Mary Groves</name>
found herself one day in
the Winchelsea country,
fell very naturally in love
with its jolly old houses,
and determined there and
then to write a story
about them. So here it
is, with a mildly romantic
hero, <title>Bernard</title>, a heroine
in the title <title>rôle</title> who
is as pretty and persecuted
as heroines should
be, a villain (<title>Lord Segrave</title>
by name—even, you see,
in those Black-Princely
days peers were a bad
lot), some conflicts not
quite so exciting as they
might have been, and
the rest of the mixture
as before. You perhaps catch already my chief ground of
complaint. Frankly I do not think that Miss <name rend="sc">Groves'</name> pen
is quite sufficiently dashing for this sort of thing. Historical
and adventurous romance, if it is to earn my vote, must keep
me out of breath the whole time. It should never be allowed
to slacken pace; and (to be entirely candid) <title>My Lady Rosia</title>
sometimes ambles rather heavily. I forgot to add that it is
published by <name rend="sc">Washbourne</name>, printed on detestable paper,
and contains some pleasant illustrations of the places mentioned
in the story. In few, the best I can say of it is that it
would make a charming gift for the young Person (if she still
survives) on the occasion, say, of a family holiday to Hastings.</p>
