                <p>In the Central Hall the Reduplicated
Præteritists, the Tangentialists and the
Paraphrasts are all well represented.
Mr. Orguly Bolp's large painting, entitled
"Embrocation," is an interesting
experiment in the handling of aplanatic
surfaces, in which the toxic determinants
are harmonized by a sort of plastic
<hi rend="it">meiosis</hi> with syncopated
rhythms. His other large
picture, "Interior of a
Dumbbell by Night," has
the same basic idea without
the appearance of it,
and gives a very vital sense
of the elimination of noumenal
perceptivity.  M.
Paparrigopoulo, the Greek
Paraphrast, calls one of his
pictures "The Antecedent,"
another "The Relative,"
and a third "The Correlative,"
but though they are
thus united syntactically
each follows its own reticulation
to a logical conclusion,
and carries with it a
spiritual sanction, not always
coherent perhaps, but
none the less satisfying.
Miss Felicity Quackenboss's
portrait of Saint Vitus is
perhaps the most arresting
contribution to the exhibition,
and portrays the
Saint intoxicated with the
exuberance of his own
agility. It is a very carnival
of contortion.  Mr.
Widgery Pimble transcribes
very searchingly the post-prandial
lethargy of a boa-constrictor,
the process of
deglutition being indicated
with great dignity and delicacy,
as might be expected
from so austere a realist.
From one angle the figure might be
taken for a Bengal tiger, and from
another for a zebra—a good proof
of the suggestiveness of the artist's
method. But, whether it be reptile
or quadruped, the spirit of repletion
broods over the canvas with irresistible
force. Mr. Thaddeus Tumulty
sends some admirable drawings in
<title>pisé de terre</title>, one of which, called
"The Pragmatist at Play," is a
masterpiece of osteological <hi rend="it">bravura</hi>....</p>

                <head>TRUTHFUL JAMES</head>
                <head>ON DOCTORS.</head>
                <p>"You're not looking well," said the
staff of <title>The Muddleton Weekly Gazette</title>
sympathetically.</p>
                <p>"No, Sir. Can't sleep, Sir. Haven't
done for days till last night. I went
off beautiful quite early, and then the
new nurse come and woke me to give
me my sleeping draught. That finished
it for the night. Strange thing, sleep.
There's no sense about it. Take Bill
Hawkins now, a pal of mine in B
Company. He was hit and took to
hospital. Not serious at all. 'Me for
a rest cure,' he says. But he was in
that hospital for weeks and weeks,
getting worse and worse; he couldn't
sleep a wink. The more they drugged
him, and the more sheep he counted,
the more wide-awake he was. The
doctors got angry and called him an
obstinate case. He said it wasn't
poisons but noise he needed, so they
fetched an orderly and set him banging
one of them frying-pan baths with a
ram-rod. In five minutes Bill falls
asleep as peaceful as a lamb, and the
orderly, being tired, stops. Up leaps
Bill, wide awake as ever, asking what's
wrong. Naturally they couldn't bang
a bath for him all night every night,
and the house surgeon was just thinking
about getting ready a slab in the
mortuary, when Bill's brother, an
engine-driver, comes along. He took
Bill to his box just outside Charing
Cross station and made up a bed for
him there. Bill slept for three days
solid and was about again in a week."</p>
                <p>"Very fortunate," murmured the
<title>Gazette</title>.</p>
                <p>"So that time, you see, the doctors
was done. But that don't often happen.
There was a doctor I knew out there,
name of Gordon. Young fellow he was,
too, and very keen; seemed to think
the War was started specially to give
him surgical practice, and he loved his
lancets more than his mother. He
used to welcome cases with open arms,
so to speak, do his very best to heal
'em quick, and weep when he succeeded.
Well, he happened to be in
our trench one day, showing our Sub
a new case of knives, when Charlie
Black was carried in on a stretcher
in an awful mess.</p>
                <p>"'I must operate at once to save
your life,' he says.</p>
                <p>"Charlie smiled as best he could and
said he was agreeable.</p>
                <p>"'But there's no anæsthetic here,'
he says, 'and I can't do it without.
Couldn't you do a faint for me?'</p>
                <p>"Charlie says he's sorry, but he's
never practised fetching a faint at will,
like a woman can.</p>
                <p>"'Well, then,' he says, 'you'll have
to be stunned.' And he fetches a small
sandbag and gives it to the stretcher-bearer.</p>
                <p>"'Chap here,' he explains to Charlie,
'will count up slowly, and when he
gets to fifty he'll hit you on the head
with the sandbag and knock you out.'</p>
                <p>"Charlie grins, and the stretcher-bearer
begins to count. When he gets
to ten he rolls up his sleeves; when he
gets to twenty he takes a good grip of
the sandbag; at thirty he rolls his
eyes and sticks out his jaw; at forty,
he lifts the bag over his shoulder and
draws one foot back, Charlie watching
him all the time. 'For-ty-six,' he
says slowly, 'for-ty seven, for-ty-eight,
for-ty-nine,' and then——"</p>
                <p>"You're not going to tell me that
he really——"</p>
                <p>"No, he didn't," said Truthful James.
"Charlie fainted."</p>
                <p>"That was their intention, I presume?"</p>
                <p>"Your presumption is correct, Sir.
The doctor finished the job before
Charlie come to again. Smart, wasn't
it?"</p>
                <p>"Very smart indeed."</p>
                <p>"But that's nothing. Nothing at
all to what he could do. He once cut
a fellow open, took out his liver, extracted
twenty-three shrapnel bullets
from it, bounced it on the floor to see
it was all right, and put it back, all
inside of three minutes. And the
fellow what owns the liver hasn't had
a to-morrow morning head-ache once
since."</p>
                <p>"He must be a very clever doctor,"
suggested the other, to fill in a pause.</p>
                <p>"Talking of doctors," James went on,
"reminds me of a man I saw out there
who wasn't a doctor, leastways not one
of ours. We was in the fire-trenches
one night when a voice hails us from
the other side of the entanglements.
After the usual questions we brings him
over the parapet, and he explains to
our Sub that he's been in front attending
to some wounded men in a listening
post what was blown up. All perfectly
correct and proper; gives his name and
rank, too, and is wearing an R.A.M.C.
uniform—rank, Captain. As he passes
me on his way to the Sub's dug-out I
happens to catch sight of his face, and
it give me quite a shock. I was took
ill immediate. I manages to stagger
to the dug-out, and I mutters hoarsely,
'Sir, I'm sick. I think I'm going to
die.'</p>
                <p>"'Sick?' says the Sub. 'You don't
look sick.'</p>
                <p>"'I'm sorry, Sir,' I says.</p>
                <p>"'Well,' says he, turning to the
other man, 'the Captain here will soon
put you right.'</p>
                <p>"'Certainly,' says the Doc very sharp.
'Where do you feel pain—stomach,
heart, head?'</p>
                <p>"'No, Sir,' says I, 'I got a nawful
pain in me inn'erds.'</p>
                <p>"'What did you say?' he asks.</p>
                <p>"'In me inn'erds, Sir,' I says,
'spreading from me gizzard to me
probossis,' them being the only out-of-the-way
words I could think of
off-hand.</p>
                <p>"'H'm,' says he, pretending to understand
perfectly, 'it is probably nothing
serious. You must diet yourself; take
nothing but light food and——'</p>
                <p>"Here the Sub interrupts him,
thinking there's something mighty
queer about a doctor what is so ready
to prescribe diet for a probossis, and
asks him a lot more questions. Of
course the beer was in the sawdust
then, and very soon a guard was called
up to take our German Captain Doctor
Spy away to a safe place.</p>
                <p>"It was lucky I knew his face. Before
perfidjus Albion forced this war on the
poor <name rend="sc">Kayser</name> I'd seen him often in
London. He was boss of a firm above
the place where I worked, and he used
to order his Huns about in their own
language, and chuck his empty lager
bottles out of his window into our
yard. I'm glad I got my own back
for that."</p>
                <p>"Jim," cried an orderly, "you're
wanted for your dressing."</p>
                <p>James rose languidly. "That means
na-poo, then, Sir," he said.</p>
                <p>"Na-poo?" echoed the <title>Gazette</title>.</p>
                <p>"Where's your learning, Sir?"
asked James. "That's French for
'no more.'"</p>
                <p>"I hope your dressing will not be
painful," ventured the other.</p>
                <p>"How would you like to have a probe
rammed through your hand twice a
day?" demanded James with a smile.
"But it's all part of the game.
Comforts for Tommy. Everyone has
their own way of making us happy,
not forgetting the dear lady what sent
us three hundred little lavender bags,
with pretty little bows on them, all
sewn by herself, to keep our linen
sweetly perfumed. It's nice to think
that they all mean well, and I always
follow the advice of the auctioneer
what was trying to pass off a plated
teapot as solid silver."</p>
                <p>"What did he say?"</p>
                <p>"Look at the bright side," answered
James over his shoulder as he hurried
away. "O reevwaw, Sir."</p>

                <head>THE PULLING OF PERCY'S LEG.</head>
                <p>It was one of those calm quarters
of an hour which sometimes happen
even in a Y.M.C.A. canteen. Private
Penny, leaning over the counter, consumed
coffee and buns and bestowed
spasmodic confidences upon me as I
cut up cake into the regulation slices.</p>
                <p>"Oxo and biscuits, please," broke in
a languid voice suddenly, and a pale
young man with an armlet approached
the counter. I turned away for the
cup, and Private Penny, laying down
his mug, addressed the newcomer.</p>
                <p>"Who are you?" he inquired genially.</p>
                <p>The young man surveyed him with
cold superiority; then he turned to me.</p>
                <p>"I'm a <name rend="sc">Derby</name> man, you see," he
began complacently. "A lot of
pals'll be here presently,
and we're all going to join
this afternoon.  They're
late."</p>
                <p>"And what," I asked
with resentment, for Private
Penny was a friend of mine,
"are you going to join?"</p>
                <p>It appeared that this
superior person, after unprejudiced
consideration of
the matter, had decided to
join the A.S.C. He said he
considered he would be of
most use in the A.S.C.; he
said he was specially designed
and constructed by
Providence for the A.S.C.;
he said....</p>
                <p>And then suddenly we
became aware that Private
Penny was mourning gently
to himself over a dough-nut.</p>
                <p>"Pore chap!" he was muttering,
"pore young feller—'e don't know.
None of 'em knows till it's too late,
and then they finds their mistake. No
good to tell 'em—pore chap, pore chap—so
pleased over it, too!"</p>
                <p>"What's that you're saying?" the
youth cut in anxiously.</p>
                <p>"Young man," said Private Penny
very solemnly, "if you'd take my
advice—the advice of one that's served
his country twelve months at the Front—you'd
let the Army Service Corps
alone. Not that I'm doubting you're
a plucky young feller enough, but you
ain't up to that. It's <hi rend="it">nerve</hi> you want
for it. Well, I wouldn't take it on myself,
and I'm pretty well seasoned.
Why, you 'ave to go calmly into the
mouth of 'ell with supplies, over the
open ground, when the Infantry's
safe and snug in the trenches. You
ain't strong enough for it—reely you
ain't."</p>
                <p>"Er—" hesitated the young man.</p>
                <p>"Well, I <hi rend="it">had</hi> thought of the R.A.M.C.
Mother's idea was——"</p>
                <p>Private Penny groaned. "You
know," he said with emotion, "I've
took a kind of fancy to you, Percy.
And if it's me dying breath I says—<title>don't!</title>
That kind of work ain't right
nor proper for the likes of you. Why,
you 'ave to go out in the field there
(and you ain't even armed, nor protected,
mind you!) and you 'ave to see
the most <hi rend="it">orrerble</hi> sights! Can't I tell
by yer face, can't I see with me understanding
eyes that you're the sort that
would go mad in no time if you 'ad
some o' them things to do? If it's me
last word——" Emotion choked him.</p>
                <p>Percy looked wildly around. "There's
the Artillery," he gasped, "if that's
your advice."</p>
                <p>Private Penny burst into a sob of
uncontrollable anguish. "Percy," he
moaned, "if you want to break me
heart, that's the way to do it! <title>Say</title>
I've advised you to that, if you like,
but it ain't true. With all me soul I
says—<title>don't</title> do it. Think, dear boy,
think. Kinsider the <title>guns!</title>—the noise—the
smoke—the smell—the bursting
shells all round—the mad horses and
mules everywhere. If you 'ave any
affection for me in your 'eart, Percival,
leave the guns alone! If you can't
control your courage for my sake—your
fool'ardiness, Percy!—think of all
your dear ones at 'ome and turn back
before it is too late!"</p>
                <p>Percy shuddered. "I might try the
Engineers," he said hopelessly, "but I
don't——"</p>
                <p>"If," said Private Penny in the still
tones of despair, "<title>I</title> have druv you to
this, I shall cut me throat. I can't
live with that on me conscience. 'Ave
you thought of the danger of mining
and sapping? 'Ave you kinsidered
field telegrafts? 'Ave you—'ot-'eaded
and impulsive as you are—'ave you
kinsidered <hi rend="it">anything</hi>? Percy, if you're
set on this job, tell me quick, and put
me out of me agony!"</p>
                <p>"No," said Percy abruptly. "But"—with
sudden misgiving—"w-what
can I do? I'm on my way to join
and I must join <hi rend="it">something</hi>."</p>
                <p>Private Penny pushed his mug over
to be re-filled. "I'm an infantryman
myself," he said carelessly, "and I
speaks as one that knows. And wot I
says is—if you wants a cheerful protected
kinder life, with a quiet 'ole to
'ide yer 'ead in—if you wants rest and
comfort, kimbined with plenty o' fresh
air—if you wants to serve yer King
and country without any danger to
yer 'ealth, then the infantry's the life
for you, and the trenches is the place
to spend it in. Ain't I been
out there one solid year,
and no 'arm 'appened to
me yet? It's child's play,
that it is, sitting there in
a 'ole, with big guns booming
over you protective-like
from be'ind and killing all
the enemy in front for you.
And yer food and yer love-letters
brought to you regular,
and doctors and parsons
to see you whenever you
feels queer. Take my advice,
Percy my son—join the
Infantry at once and make
sure of a gentleman's life.
I've took a fancy to you,
and I tells you straight."
And he eclipsed himself
behind his replenished mug.</p>
                <p>"Thank you very much,"
said Percy gratefully, "I can
see that the Infantry is the place for me.
I shall insist upon joining it. Thank
you <hi rend="it">very</hi> much for all your advice——"</p>
                <p>At this moment a great wave of
khaki burst into the room and swept to
the counter, clamouring for attention.
On the crest of it came Percy's friends
in mufti, and once, across the tumult,
his voice reached my ears. "... quite
decided...." he was saying loftily,
"some infantry regiment or other
just seems...." and he was jostled
away in the centre of an admiring
group.</p>
                <p>Involuntarily I looked across at
Private Penny.</p>
                <p>One eye met mine from behind an
upturned mug, and the lid fell and rose
again, once, rapidly; he too had heard.</p>

                <p>A new and very popular addition to
the comic opera, <title>Tina</title>, at the Adelphi,
is a stage representation of "Eve," the
writer of "The Letters of Eve" in
<title>The Tatler</title>, together with her retinue
and her dog.</p>
                <p>Here we see Journalism and the
Drama more than ever mutually dependent,
and the developments of the
idea might be numberless. <title>Lord Times</title>,
in <title>A Kiss for Cinderella</title>, already illustrates
one of them; but why not a
complete play, with favourite newspaper
contributors as the <title>dramatis
personæ</title>? or a revue, to be called, say,
<title>The Tenth Muse</title>, or <title>Hullo, Inky</title>!</p>
                <p>Or, if not a whole play or revue, a
scene could be arranged in which the
great scribes processed past. One group
might consist of Carmelite Friars, with
"Quex" and "The Rambler," each with
a luncheon host on one arm and a
musical-comedy actress on the other;
"An Englishman," with his scourge
of knotted cords, on his eternal but
honourable quest for a malefactor; and
"Robin Goodfellow," still, in spite of
war and official requests for economy,
pointing to the glories of the race-course
and pathetically endeavouring
to find winners. These would make
an impressive company—with a good
song and dance to finish up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>The Referee's</title> contribution would
obviously be too easy; it would simply
be like a revival of <title>King Arthur</title>. The
audience, however, would be in luck
when "Dagonet" got really warmed
up to tell yet once more the thrilling
story of how he met <name rend="sc">Henry Pettitt</name>
in the brave days of old.</p>
                <p>A whiff of <title>The Three Musketeers</title>
would exhilarate the house at the entry
of "Chicot," the Jester of <title>The Sketch</title>;
while finally we might look for an
excellent effect from "Claudius Clear"
and "A Man of Kent," of <title>The British
Weekly</title>, masquerading as the Heavenly
Twins.</p>
                <p>These notes merely, of course, touch
the fringe of a vast subject. Many
other holders of famous <title>noms de
guerre</title> remain, such as "Mr. Gossip"
and "Mrs. Gossip," and "Captain
Coe" and "A Playful Stallite," and
"Historicus" and "Atlas" and "Scrutator"
and "Alpha of the Plough";
but only "Eve" has had the wit to
include pictures of herself in every
article; therefore only "Eve" can be
instantly recognised. These others, if
they wish to be equally successful
on the stage (and it is certain they
would like to be), must have always a
portrait too. The Heavenly Twins
might like to use one, by Mr. <name rend="sc">Wells</name>,
which already exists.</p>

                <head>THE DOVE.</head>
                <p>I was at first inclined to look upon this dove as being
largely symbolical. So far as I could gather it had never
been here before—at any rate no one could be found who
had seen it here or in the neighbourhood, and it seemed
obvious that its sudden emergence, as it were, out of
nothing must have some high and dove-like signification.</p>
                <p>Probably before the end
of the week the <name rend="sc">Kaiser</name>
would sue for peace and
swallow Mr. <name rend="sc">Asquith's</name>
formula. Since then,
however, Verdun has
happened and <name rend="sc">von
Tirpitz</name> has gone, and
nobody seems in the
least disposed to stop
the crash of arms. That
being so, and the dove
being still with us, I
am forced, in spite of
myself, to look upon it
as an entirely real bird
and to keep on wondering
what strange
freak brought it to us
and made it an honoured
member of this
household.</p>
                <p>It arrived about ten
weeks ago quite unexpectedly
and suddenly.
One morning there was
no dove; on the following
morning, having
fluttered hither from I
know not what remote
and solitary region, it
had perched on the
branch of a poplar set
close to the house.
There it remained while
we breakfasted, and
from that point of
vantage it broke out
into a long series of
loud and melodious
cooings that sounded
like nothing so much
as a gurgling stream
of benedictions poured
out over the house and
those who dwelt in it
by one who plainly
proposed to be a grateful
though not a paying
guest. It was wonderful to hear it.</p>
                <p>From the branch this persistent and pleasing bird
shortly removed itself to the window-sill of one of the
bedrooms, and into this room, when breakfast was over,
the children trooped. The dove was pecking eagerly at the
window-pane. "Let's open the window for it," said one
of the girls, "and see what happens." Very gently, then,
the window was opened, and what immediately happened
was that, without the least sign of alarm, nay rather with
the air of one repeating a customary action, the dove
walked in, took a short flight, and settled on the toilet-table.
There it caught sight of its soft grey reflection
in the looking-glass and at once began to parade up and
down before it, swelling itself out and bobbing its head in
evident admiration of the beautiful being so fortunately
offered to its view. Soon it attempted to approach this
vision, but was surprised to find itself foiled by the cold impermeable
surface of the glass. Puzzled, but not, I think,
definitely hopeless—it performs the same antics in one or
other of the bedrooms every day—it left the toilet-table,
circled round the room
and perched confidingly
on the shoulder of one
of the little girls who
were admiring it, and
began once more to
coo in a very ecstasy
of enjoyment.</p>
                <p>Later on, food was
provided for it, which it
pecked up without the
least shyness. Since
then it has established
itself on a very firm
clawing, if I may use
the term, as a necessary
inmate of the house.
Fluttering through the
passages it follows the
maids from room to
room in the morning
and shows the most
lively interest in their
work while beds are
being made or tables
dusted. It has the
most perfect trustfulness,
not merely allowing
itself to be handled,
but coming to perch
on a wrist or shoulder
as if it had belonged
there from, time immemorial.
It really is
a pretty thing to have
about the house, an
embodiment of gentleness
and kindness, and,
so far as a mere human
being can judge, of an
almost dog-like gratitude
and affection. I
have seen a bullfinch
swell up in a passionate
agitation of love when
from its cage it beheld
its dear mistress enter
the room, but it had
never occurred to me
before this to attribute such a feeling to a dove. I ought,
I suppose, to have known better, as I now do. At this
very moment it is cooing away like mad at its declaration
of undying love from its favourite haunt on the mantelpiece
of one of the bedrooms.</p>
                <p>But it has another utterance which it employs at rare
intervals. This is a sort of high-pitched laugh thoroughly
unsuited to its softness, a most cynical and derisive sound
which in so kind a beak seems to have neither meaning
nor purpose. But I overlook its rare laugh in consideration
of the cooing with which it blesses us and the general
friendship which it has vowed to this house.</p>

                <p>"Rather a funny thing happened
the other day," she remarked.</p>
                <p>"Yes?" I replied languidly.</p>
                <p>"About you."</p>
                <p>"Oh!" I said with animation. "Do
tell me."</p>
                <p>"It was at lunch," she explained,
"at Duke's. The people at the next
table were talking about you. I couldn't
help hearing a little. A man there
said he had met you in Shanghai."</p>
                <p>"Not really!" I exclaimed.</p>
                <p>"Yes. He met you in Shanghai."</p>
                <p>"That's frightfully interesting," I
said. "What did he say about me?"</p>
                <p>"That's what I couldn't hear," she
replied. "You see I had to pay some
attention to my own crowd. I only
caught the word 'delightful.'"</p>
                <p>Ever since she told me this. I have
been turning it over in my mind; and
it is particularly vexing not to know
more. "Delightful" can be such jargon
and mean nothing—or, at any rate,
nothing more than amiability. Still,
that is something, for one is not always
amiable, even when meeting
strangers.  On the other hand it
might be, from this man, the highest
praise.</p>
                <p>The whole thing naturally leads to
thought, because I have never been
farther east than Athens in my life.</p>
                <p>Yet here is a man who met me in
Shanghai. What does it mean? Can
we possibly visit other cities in our
sleep? Has each of us an <title>alter ego</title>,
who can really behave, elsewhere?</p>
                <p>Whether we have or not, I know that
this information about my Shanghai
double is going to be a great nuisance
to me. It is going to change my character.
In fact it has already begun to
do so. Let me give you an example.</p>
                <p>Only yesterday I was about to be
very angry with a telegraph boy who
brought back a telegram I had despatched
about two hours earlier,
saying that it could not be delivered
because it was insufficiently addressed.
Obviously it was not the boy's fault,
for he belonged to our country post-office
and the telegram had been sent
to London and was returned from there;
and yet I started to abuse that boy as
though he were not only the <name rend="sc">Postmaster-General</name>
himself but the inventor
of red-tape into the bargain.
And all for a piece of carelessness of
my own.</p>
                <p>And then suddenly I remembered
Shanghai and how delightful I was
there. And I shut up instantly and
apologised and rewrote the message
and gave the boy a shilling for himself.
If one could be delightful in
Shanghai one must be delightful at
home too.</p>
                <p>And so it is going to be. There is
very little fun for me in the future,
and all because of that nice-mannered
man in Shanghai whom I must not
disgrace. For it would be horrible if
one day a lady told him that she
had overheard someone who had met
him in London and found him to be
a bear.</p>

                    <title>Tuesday, March 28th.</title>—Sir <name rend="sc">Edward
Carson</name> was back on the Front Opposition
Bench to-day, so much the better
for his recent rest-cure that he is
credited with the desire to prescribe
similar treatment for other jaded politicians.
Three of the potential patients—the
<name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name>, the <name rend="sc">Foreign
Secretary</name> and the <name rend="sc">Minister of Munitions</name>—have
anticipated his kindly
suggestion by going for a little
trip on the Seine, and are
making arrangements with
their Continental friends for
another on the Spree at a
later date.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>Before his departure Mr.
<name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name>, ever thoughtful
for the welfare of others,
arranged with the Military
authorities to give a change
of scene to six members of
the Clyde Workers' Committee,
who have been recently over-straining
their vocal chords.
This was the impression I got
from Dr. <name rend="sc">Addison</name>, who, like
his great namesake, is a master
of the bland style; but Sir
<name rend="sc">Edward Carson</name> thrust aside
official euphemism and bluntly
inquired whether these men
were not in fact assisting the
<name rend="sc">King's</name> enemies, and ought not
to be indicted for high treason.</p>
                <p>The suppression of a number
of <title>Sinn Fein</title> papers in Ireland
stimulated Mr. <name rend="sc">Ginnell</name> to the
concoction of a Question about
as long as a leading article.
To ensure a reply he addressed
it simultaneously to the <name rend="sc">Under
Secretary for War</name> and the
<name rend="sc">Chief Secretary for Ireland</name>.
In spite of this precaution
he was disappointed,
for, owing to the storm, Mr.
<name rend="sc">Birrell</name> had not received the
necessary information from
Ireland, while Mr. <name rend="sc">Tennant</name>, no doubt
for the same reason, had not even received
the Question. Mr. <name rend="sc">Ginnell</name> is
now convinced that the official conspiracy
against him has been joined by
the Clerk of the Weather.</p>
                <p>I shall hardly be surprised if the
next time I walk down Whitehall I
find sandwichmen out with their boards
inscribed—</p>
                <lg>

                        <l>Billing Breaks all Records.</l>
                    </lg>
                </lg>
                <p>The new Member for East Herts has
displayed unprecedented dexterity in
catching the <name rend="sc">Speaker's</name> eye. In three
weeks he has already spoken more
columns of <title>Hansard</title> than many Members
fill during a long Parliamentary
career. His speech to-day consisted
almost entirely of a catalogue of fatal
accidents to aviators, due, he declared,
to the faulty engines and machines
supplied to them by the Government—"though
within twenty miles of here
we have a far better machine than the
<title>Fokker</title>."</p>
                <p>Previous to this we had listened to
a bright and diverting dialogue between
Mr. <name rend="sc">Dudley Ward</name>, representing the
Anti-Aircraft Service, and Mr. <name rend="sc">Joynson-Hicks</name>,
briefed by the Municipal authorities,
on the question of what happened
at Ramsgate during the last
raid. As they differed <title>in toto</title> on every
detail the House was not much the
wiser for the discussion, but it was
consoled by Mr. <name rend="sc">Joynson-Hicks'</name> remark
that "if the <name rend="sc">Mayor</name> and <name rend="sc">Town
Clerk</name> have lied to me no one will be
more pleased than myself."</p>
                <p>Members were much more impressed
by the obvious sincerity and occasional
eloquence of the appeal on behalf of
the East Coast towns made by Sir A.
<name rend="sc">Gelder</name>. His indignation at the trick
played on one place by the Military
authorities, who tried to allay public
anxiety by mounting a dummy gun,
was shared by the House.</p>
                <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">Tennant</name> did not attempt to deny
or palliate this imposture, but he made
a fairly adequate reply to other counts
of the indictment, and promised a
judicial inquiry into the casualties
enumerated by Mr. <name rend="sc">Billing</name>. The
revelation that he himself has a son
in the Flying Corps was perhaps the
most effective point in a speech which
did not wholly remove the
impression that the Government
has its head in the air
rather than its heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Wednesday, March 29th.</title>—There
are more ways than one
of getting into the House of
Commons. Mr. <name rend="sc">Percy Harris</name>,
the new Member for the Market
Harborough division, who
took his seat to-day, arrived by
the old-fashioned route of a
contested election. He was
just about to shake hands with
the <name rend="sc">Speaker</name> when a khaki-clad
stranger took a short cut
from the Gallery and reached
the floor <title>per saltum</title>. Not only
so, but before he could be
arrested this Messenger from
Mars succeeded in delivering
his maiden speech, to the
effect that British soldiers'
heads should be protected
against shrapnel-fire. The
<name rend="sc">Serjeant-at-Arms</name>, who had
had a narrow escape, goes
further, holding the view that
his own head should be protected
from acrobatic British
soldiers.</p>
                <p>To-day Mr. <name rend="sc">Long</name> had the
difficult task of convincing the
House that the married men
had no grievance, and that
the Government were doing
their best to remove it. Only
a man who has fought with
bulls in Ireland could hope to
tackle such a paradox. Mr. <name rend="sc">Long</name>,
having enjoyed that experience, was
fairly successful.</p>
                <p>Sir <name rend="sc">Edward Carson</name>, who had been
expected by some people to initiate a
raging "Down-the-Government" agitation,
was comparatively mild, and,
admitting that his late colleagues had
done something, chiefly blamed them
for not having done it earlier. Still he
made it plain that in his view compulsion
all round was inevitable if Prussianism
was to be crushed. Mr. <name rend="sc">Ellis
Griffith</name> agreed with him. The Government
ought not to bargain with the
public; it ought to give them a clear
and definite command. Such sentiments,
proceeding from one who still
<pb xml:id="page235" n="pg 235"/>
claimed to belong to the Liberal Party,
shocked Sir <name rend="sc">William Byles</name>. Maintaining
that those who had voted
against the Military Service Bill were
the truest friends of the <name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name>,
he promised again to give him
his invaluable support "if he would
only lead us to our accustomed pasture."
There is no justification, however,
for the theory that the worthy
knight is a candidate for the Order of
the Thistle.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Thursday, March 30th.</title>—In the Lords
to-day Viscount <name rend="sc">Templetown</name> moved
that London should be declared a prohibited
area, with a view to removing
the eight or nine thousand Germans
still carrying on business there. His
argument was a little difficult to follow,
for it included a complaint that in Eastbourne,
which is a prohibited area, a
number of aliens are residing in comfort
and affluence. The Marquis of <name rend="sc">Lansdowne</name>,
usually so logical, on this
occasion answered inconsequence by
inconsequence. In one breath he
asserted that to declare the whole of
the Metropolis a prohibited area would
throw too much work on the police;
and in the next that it would have the
effect of driving away large numbers of
aliens to places not so well policed as
London is.</p>
                <p>Lord <name rend="sc">Beresford</name> caught the infection.
In the course of a long question designed
to clear General <name rend="sc">Townshend</name> of the responsibility
for the advance upon Bagdad,
he remarked with startling irrelevance
that if his (Lord <name rend="sc">Beresford</name>'s)
advice had been taken by the <name rend="sc">Prime
Minister</name> the <title>Lusitania</title> would still
be afloat and we should have lost no
battleships in the Dardanelles. He did
not appear to attach undue importance
to this claim, and Lord <name rend="sc">Islington</name>, who
replied for the Government, did not
think it necessary to make any reference
to it, but contented himself with
stating that the Bagdad advance was
authorised on the advice of General
<name rend="sc">Nixon</name> and the Indian Government,
and professing official ignorance of any
representations on the part of General
<name rend="sc">Townshend</name>.</p>
                <p>In the Commons the trouble on the
Clyde was the <title>pièce de résistance</title>.
At Question time Mr. <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name>,
fresh from the Paris Conference, had
to deal with a number of inquiries
put by the little group of Scottish
malcontents whose notion of patriotism
is to embarrass the Government
on each and every occasion. Mr.
<name rend="sc">Hogge</name> wanted to know when the
<name rend="sc">Minister of Munitions</name> was going to
give the other side of the case—"the
German side," as an interrupter pertinently
put it; and Mr. <name rend="sc">Pringle</name> intimated
that a settlement could have been
reached but for the unreasonableness of
the Government.</p>
                <p>This gave Dr. <name rend="sc">Addison</name>, usually the
mildest-mannered man that ever lanced
a gumboil, an opportunity of administering
to big accuser a much-needed
lesson in deportment. The hon. Member
had first forced himself, without
invitation, into a private conversation
in the Minister's room, and had then
given a totally misleading account of
what took place. He had made himself
the spokesman of a body which had
displayed "a treacherous disregard of
the highest national interests."</p>
                <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">Pringle</name> was as much surprised
as if he had been bitten by a rabbit,
and wound up an unconvincing defence
of himself with the remark that he
would rather keep silence than say
anything to exacerbate feeling. It is a
pity that his friend Mr. <name rend="sc">Hogge</name> did not
imitate this wise if rather tardy reticence.
He gave Mr. <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name>
the lie when he was describing how
the disputes had interfered with the
supply of guns urgently needed by the
Army, and provoked the retort that,
instead of encouraging the strikers by
unfounded suggestions, he would be
better employed if "with what credit
is left to him" he went down to the
Clyde and tried to get them to work.</p>

Rents. I had come upon these
two young men about Fulham
as they were staring with absorbed
interest into the undertaker's
shop advantageously
situated for custom at the
corner of the Rents and the
main street. Certainly it was
a pleasant window. Besides
the legends and texts, the artificial
wreaths and the pictures
of tombs and tombstones, there
was a number of model coffins
in miniature. It was these
that had fascinated the attention
of the two young men.</p>
                <p>"I should like one o' them
to ply with," said the elder
covetously.</p>
                <p>"What would yer do with
it, Bill?" the younger asked.</p>
                <p>"I'd put the old <name rend="sc">Kayser</name> in it, along
wi' Farver."</p>
                <p>It is rude to laugh at other people's
conversation, particularly if you have
not been introduced to them, but I
caught myself in an audible chuckle
over this fine blend of patriotic and
filial sentiment. Then I pulled myself
but not in time; I had been
detected.</p>
                <p>If you wish to know what it is to be
stared at, you should interrupt, as I
had, a conversation between two
young men of about this age in
Fulham or elsewhere. They stared in
unison and in silence until the tension
became unbearable, and one of them,
the elder, whose name was Bill, relieved
it with the above quest on, "Kin yer
write a letter?"</p>
                <p>Perhaps my answer was a little
modest. He regarded me doubtfully,
then asked—</p>
                <p>"'Ow soon kin yer write a letter?"</p>
                <p>"You mean, how long does it take
me to write a letter?"</p>
                <p>He nodded his head vehemently.</p>
                <p>"Well," I began, "it rather depends,
you know, on what there is to say." I
saw dissatisfaction cloud his face, and
hastened to add, "Oh, well, about ten
minutes."</p>
                <p>At that his expression cleared to
astonishment. Passing that emotion,
it went to incredulity. It was a beautifully
legible face, though everything
but clean. He made up his mind.</p>
                <p>"Will yer come," he asked, "and
write a letter for my granmother?"</p>
                <p>We were on the heels of adventure
now; no one could say what new
country this might lead to.</p>
                <p>"Where does she live?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"Just round the corner, two doors
from my Great-aunt Maria's," he said,
astonished that I should not know,</p>
                <p>"Lead on," I said, concealing my
ignorance of the residence of great-aunt
Maria.</p>
                <p>He took me by the hand, which I
could not in courtesy decline, and led
me down Paradise Rents.</p>
                <p>As a rule, in Paradise Rents, front
doors stand open to the street, but
the door of Number 5, the abode of
Bill's grandmother, was shut. On tip-toe
and with a strenuous effort Bill
reached the latch. The door opened
and Bill shouted through it, by way of
introduction:—</p>
                <p>"She says she kin write a letter in
ten minutes."</p>
                <p>The person addressed, whom I understood
to be the grandmother, was
engaged in scrubbing with a duster a
deal table already clean enough to
make Bill's face much ashamed of itself.
She was a large heavy old woman,
with a round colourless visage that
suggested the full moon by daylight,
and wispy grey locks like a nimbus
about it.</p>
                <p>"Lor bless the child, Mum!" she
exclaimed. "Bill, whatever d'yer mean
by it?"</p>
                <p>"Says she kin write a letter in ten
minutes," Bill repeated, with the emphasis
of grave doubt on the "says."</p>
                <p>"Bless the child, Mum! I don't
know whatever 'e's been saying. It's
truth as I did say as I wished I 'ad
someone as could write a letter for me
to my son Frank, it being 'is birthday
Tuesday and 'im out at the Front.
But there, it's not to say, as I can't
write a letter myself if I'm so minded,
but I'm no great scholard and it do
take me a long time to finish—each
day a word or two. About a week it
take me to write a letter, such a letter
as I'd wish to write to Frank out at
the Front, for 'is birthday, to cheer
'im up."</p>
                <p>"Frank's Bill's father, I
suppose?" I said, by way of
filling an asthmatic pause.</p>
                <p>"Lor bless yer, no, Mum.
Bill's father wouldn't never
go into no more danger than
what 'e'd find at the Red
Lion. Married my pore
daughter 'e did, as died—a
mercy for 'er, pore thing!
That's 'ow it is Bill's living
along o' me."</p>
                <p>"I see," I said. "Well, now—about
the letter?"</p>
                <p>A space more liberal than
the operation strictly needed
was cleared for me on the
polished deal table; a penny
ink-bottle and a pen with a
rusty but still useful nib set
upon it, and from a special
drawer, with a solemnity that
of the character of
sacred ritual, Mrs. Watt, as Bill's
grandmother informed me she was
called, drew forth a single sheet of
notepaper. Its dimensions had been
heavily curtailed by the deepest border
of mourning black that I ever had
seen on English writing-paper. Other
nations surpass us in this evidence of
respect, but Mrs. Watt's paper was calculated
to raise the national standard.</p>
                <p>"Isn't this," I said, "rather—I
mean is it quite suited for a birthday
letter, to cheer up Frank in the
trenches?"</p>
                <p>Mrs. Watt took the suggestion in
quite good part, but gave it a decided
negative.</p>
                <p>"'E would wish respect showed to
'is Aunt Maria, as died Wednesday
was a fortnight. You might tell 'im
that, if you please, Mum."</p>
                <p>I started off, as bidden, with this
mournful communication, under
the eye, at first severely critical, then
frankly admiring, of Bill's grandmother.</p>
                <pb xml:id="page237" n="pg 237"/>
                <p>"Lor," she exclaimed, "you be one
to write the words quick!"</p>
                <p>"What shall we say now?" I asked
brightly.</p>
                <p>"Wednesday was a fortnight as she
died, sister Maria did, that's Frank's
aunt, and was buried a Saturday—what's
too soon, as you'd say, but
no disrespect meant, the undertaker
arranging first for the Monday—only
'aving a bigger job, with 'orses and
plumes, give'im for the Monday, and so
putting my pore sister forward to the
Saturday. 'Ave you got that down,
Mum?"</p>
                <p>"Oh," I said, scribbling briskly, "am
I to write all that?" It occupied, even
with much compression, space far into
the second side of the restricted paper.</p>
                <p>"An' my only relative surviving,"
she resumed, "being brother George,
as is eighty-two, and crotchety at that,
lives out 'Oxton way, so I wrote to him
about the funeral for a Monday, and
when the undertaker puts it forward to
the Saturday I didn't have no one to
send all that way, so brother George—'e's
eighty-two, and crotchety at that—'e
didn't get no notice for the funeral
on Saturday at all, so o' course 'e didn't
come. You'll make all that clear to
Frank, won't you, Mum?"</p>
                <p>I scribbled hard again, and said I
was doing my best.</p>
                <p>"So brother George being crotchety,
as I said, Mum, 'e sent me word as 'e
wouldn't never speak to me again in
this world, and 'e didn't know as ever
'e would in the world to come—I'd
like you to put that all in, please,
Mum, so's to let Frank know 'ow it
all is. Now, do you suppose, Mum,
if I was to die, as brother George'd
come to my funeral?"</p>
                <p>I hardly knew what answer to make
after the "cut everlasting" with which
George had threatened his sister, but
I had an idea that I was beginning to
understand Mrs. Watt's tastes. "Well,"
I said weakly, "I don't know—funerals
are very pleasant things."</p>
                <p>It was the right note and Mrs. Watt
took it up keenly. "That's what I
always says, Mum," she said eagerly.
"I'd sooner go to a good funeral than
I would a wedding any day of the week.
You've got that down about brother
George? Yes, and please say as it was
beautiful polished wood, the coffin—and
real brass 'andles."</p>
                <p>"But, Mrs. Watt," I said despairingly,
"that'll bring us quite to the
end of the paper, and we've never even
wished him many happy returns yet.
Have you another sheet?"</p>
                <p>"I haven't got no more than the one
sheet, but I dessay as there's room to
say as I'm his loving mother, and
'ope it finds 'im well, as it leaves me."</p>
                <p>I managed to pinch in the traditional
salutation; the sheet was enclosed in
an envelope as sepulchral of aspect
as itself, and with much misgiving I
put Frank's birthday letter into the
first pillar-box that I found.</p>
                <p>Just a week later I had occasion to
go down Paradise Rents again. I had
no intention of calling on Mrs. Watt,
being more than a little afraid of the
reception that her son Frank might
have accorded to the letter that was
to bring bright cheer to his birthday.
But she ran from her door as I passed
to meet and greet me. "Do step in,
Mum," she entreated. "I must 'ave
you see a letter as come this morning
from my son Frank, as is at the Front.
Read that, if you please, Mum."</p>
                <p>"She must be a real lady that wot
comes visiting you," it said. "That
was a letter as she wrote. I don't
know as ever I read such a beautiful
letter. All the trench 'as read it, and
they says so too."</p>
                <p>I sighed heavily with relief. Mrs.
Watt was a judge of her son's literary
taste.</p>

                    <p>The Merry Monarch's world is too
much with us. I can't imagine what
it is in that period that our actor-managers
find so peculiarly appropriate
to present conditions, when we need all
the inspiration we can get out of our
country's annals. It seems only the
other day that in the same theatre,
His Majesty's—the play was <title>Mavourneen</title>—I
was assisting at a rout (is
that the word?) of Restoration society.
And here we have it all over again
with the same scheme of a pretty <title>débutante</title>
near to being compromised by
the Royal favour; with the old galaxy
of Court ladies inexplicably gay; the
same old Duke of <name rend="sc">Buckingham</name>; the
old dull sport of improvisations; the
old pathetic lack of wit; a <title>réchauffé</title>
only tempered by slight variations,
such as the substitution of <name rend="sc">Lely</name> for
<name rend="sc">Pepys</name>, and the failure of the Monarch
himself to put in an appearance.</p>
                    <p>For the rest, a generous allowance
of swashbuckling, of kidnapping, of
standing and delivering, of interludes
for dancing and gallantry—in a word
all the approved features of the High
Toby. Nothing, you will guess, that
threatened to overstrain our intelligence,
but enough for the moderate
excitation of those sympathies which
we always concede to heroic villainy.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="it">clou</hi> of the evening was the
scene of the waylaying of his lover's
coach by <title>Claude Duval</title> on the Newmarket
road. Animals on the stage (as
distinct from the circus-ring) always
make me nervous. Mr. <name rend="sc">Bourchier</name>
seemed to have anticipated my apprehension.
On the approach of the
travellers, having hitherto, with his
horse's consent, sat motionless at the
cross-roads, he retired with it into the
wings and there dismounted and continued
the scene on foot. But the
memory of those few moments of
superb equitation remained with the
audience, and when, at the fall of the
curtain, he led his steed forward by the
bridle (a just tribute to its connivance)
the pair of them brought down the
house—and not the scenery, as I had
feared.</p>
                    <p>I am no pedant that I should cavil
at Mr. <name rend="sc">Justin Huntly McCarthy's</name> re-adjustment
of history. It was all for
our delight that <title>Claude Duval</title>, instead
of perishing on the scaffold, should
escape from prison, have his freedom
confirmed by the <name rend="sc">King's</name> pardon, confound
everybody else's knavish tricks
and marry the lady of his heart. Nor
do I complain that the historic highwayman
(as I am credibly informed—for
I got the facts from another critic)
was only twenty-nine when they hanged
him, and that Mr. <name rend="sc">Bourchier</name> is—well,
let me say, past the military age,
or he wouldn't have been there at all.
At the same time he will not mind my
saying that, though he brought a very
gallant spirit to his work, he lacked
something of that resilience which is
so desirable a quality in a Chevalier of
the Road. Perhaps I liked best in
him the quiet restraint with which he
met the assaults of <title>Orange Moll</title> upon
his loyalty to his lady. He was not
given very many good things to say, but
he made up for this defect by dropping
his aspirates and talking in what I
took to be a Serbian accent.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <graphic url="images/238.png"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Not much subtlety was asked of
Miss <name rend="sc">Kyrle Bellew</name> as <title>Duval's</title> lover,
<title>Berinthia</title>; but she seemed to have
learned a little more sincerity and to
depend less upon the prettiness of her
face and her frocks. Of Miss <name rend="sc">Miriam
Lewes</name> as <title>Orange Moll</title> something
more was demanded, and I should have
enjoyed without reservation her very
picturesque performance but for a
certain stage-quality in her voice
which was out of all consonance with
the part she had to play. Mr. <name rend="sc">Jerrold
Robertshaw</name> as <title>Justice Hogben</title> was
a most attractive old reprobate; Mr.
<name rend="sc">Charles Rock</name> as a strolling mummer
played like the sound actor he is; and
indeed the whole cast—and not least
in the smallest parts, such as Mr.
<name rend="sc">Hartford's</name> drunken <title>Gaoler</title> and Mr.
<name rend="sc">Pease's</name>
                        <title>Dognose</title>, with his delightfully
unemotional "Ay! ay!"—did very
well indeed.</p>
                    <p>If the play opens rather deliberately
there is no lack of action when once it
gets moving; but it was an exercise of
bodies rather than of minds. Swords
flashed; barkers were flourished
(though they never went off); feet
twinkled in the dance, and Mr. <name rend="sc">Murray
Carrington</name> took several astounding
falls; but wits remained stationary. I
do not wish to appear exigent, but as
one who likes to be amused as well as
entertained I could easily have done
with a little more scintillation.</p>

                    <p>A literature of <title>Antarcticana</title> is gradually growing up,
and the last volume, <title>With Scott: The Silver Lining</title> (<name rend="sc">Smith,
Elder</name>), is a notable addition to it. Let me say at once
that I opened Mr. <name rend="sc">Griffith Taylor's</name> book with some
trembling because I saw the difficulties in the way of its
success. In the first place I recalled the simple dignity with
which <name rend="sc">Scott</name> wrote of his exploits, and I felt that to fall
away from this high standard would be to fail; secondly,
anyone writing now of this expedition must to a certain
extent travel over ground already covered. These are the
main difficulties which Mr. <name rend="sc">Taylor</name> had to fight against,
and he has overcome them. To a writer of his fluency and
particular vein of humour it could not have been an easy
task to put a right restraint upon his pen. The only
criticism I have to pass on his style is that it could quite
comfortably have done without
the cloud of notes of
exclamation in which it is
enveloped. Apart from its
great scientific value the
main interest of the book
is found in the light that it
casts upon the characters of
the author's companions.
His observation is always
shrewd and always kindly;
you are left to guess his
dislikes from his omissions.
Mr. <name rend="sc">Taylor</name> was himself in
command, during <name rend="sc">Scott's</name>
last expedition, of two parties,
and of the work done
on these journeys he writes
with the modesty characteristic
of men who speak
of dangers and adventures
in which they have personally
taken part. One
opinion of his I cannot refrain
from quoting; it is
that the tragedy of <name rend="sc">Scott's</name>
expedition was caused by
Seaman <name rend="sc">Evans's</name> illness.
"I believe that, short of
abandonment, the party had
no hope with a sick man on their hands." No tale of
heroism that the War has given us can obscure the noble
loyalty of this sacrifice. And to-day, when some of us
have neither the time nor the taste for lighter things, there
should be a grateful welcome for a book that deals with
men whose courage and endurance remain the imperishable
possession of our race.</p>

                    <p>Somewhere towards the end of <title>The Tragedy of an Indiscretion</title>
(<name rend="sc">Lane</name>), we arrive at the Court of Criminal Appeal,
where, in the course of unravelling the plot, one of the
judges is moved to exclaim, "This is the most hopelessly
complicated story I ever had the pain of listening to!"
His lordship certainly has my sympathy. Personally speaking,
the first twenty pages of it nearly gave me a nervous
breakdown, so wild and whirling were the events into
which it plunged. Let me start the thing for you. <title>Ronald
Warrington</title>, who was heir to the aged <title>Duke of Glenstaffen</title>,
eloped with <title>Mrs. Greville</title>, assuming for no very understandable
reason the name of his friend and secretary,
<title>Essendine</title>. So, the pair being established at an hotel, the
supposed <title>Mr. E.</title> goes to a station to buy an evening paper,
is fallen upon by the real one, and thrust into a train to
attend the deathbed of his ducal relative. <title>Essendine</title> himself,
entering the hotel to explain matters to the lady, finds
(1) that she is the wife who divorced him before marrying
<title>Greville</title>; (2) that she has just died of heart disease. Next,
being of a placidity almost inhuman, he decides to bury the
corpse as that of his wife, and not worry anyone with
explanations. What he didn't know then, or I either,
was that another lady was at the moment gadding about
London in one of <title>Mrs. Greville's</title> cast-off frocks, and pretending
to be that much-married female. And when in
due course she is murdered, and the strangely apathetic
widower, <title>Mr. Greville</title>, who never set eyes upon her, is
arrested for the crime—well, you may begin to think that
the judge's remark was an understatement. What I should
like to ask Mr. <name rend="sc">J. W. Brodie-Innes</name> is, if this is his notion
of an "indiscretion," what would he have to say of a real
social error?</p>

                    <p>The name of the author
of <title>Youth Unconquerable</title>
(<name rend="sc">Heinemann</name>) is given on
the title-page as <title>Percy
Ross</title>. But I would willingly
take a small wager
on the probability that this
name conceals a feminine
identity. For one thing, no
mere man surely would
attempt the task of depicting
the sweet girl graduate
in her native lair, often
as the converse has been
done. Certainly it is improbable
that he would manage
to convey such an impression
of actuality. For I am
sure the life of an Oxford
ladies' college must be, for
many, very much what it
was for <title>Cherry Hawthorn</title>.
But I am afraid this is
about all that I can honestly
say in praise of the story.
<title>Cherry</title> was a young woman
with red hair (it is bright
vermilion in the ugly picture
of her on the cover) and no fortune. Her late father
had made her the joint ward of two young men, one an
Italian prince, and one a semi-insane Welshman. <title>Cherry</title>
accepted this provision with a promising placidity. She, and
I, anticipated marriage with one or other of the guardians.
But that was before we had seen them. The Italian turned
out to be silly, while the Welshman recalled the gloomier
imaginings of the <name rend="sc">Brontës</name>, and in the event came by an
appropriately violent end. However there was a third
suitor, a Scotch Duke, so all was well. Perhaps the tale
may have more success with others than with me. But I
am bound to warn you that the style of it is a wild and
wonderful thing. One is, for example, unprepared to find a
gentleman's hat and stick referred to as "his extra-mural
accoutrements." And this is no rare example. The whole
thing, in fact, seems more suitable to a very popular
magazine than to the dignity of that exclusive little windmill
that forms the <name rend="sc">Heinemann</name> hall-mark.</p>
