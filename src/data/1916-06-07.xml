                <p>A correspondent writes to tell us of
a painful experience which he has had
in consequence of his efforts to practise
war-time economy in the matter of
dress. The other evening, after going
to bed at dusk in order to save artificial
light, he was rung up by the police
at 1 <name rend="sc">A.M.</name> and charged with showing a
light. It appears that he had gone to
bed with his blind up, after throwing
his well-worn trousers over the back of
a chair, and that the rays of a street
lamp had caught the glossy sheen of
this garment and been reflected into
the eagle eye of the constable.</p>

                <p>According to a Reuter's message the
Greeks are "much preoccupied" at the
seizure of strategic positions on Greek
territory by Bulgarian troops. The
preoccupation, it is thought, should
have been done by the Allies.</p>

                <p>While he was on his way to make
a Memorial Day speech at Kansas City,
Mo., an open knife was thrown at Ex-President
<name rend="sc">Roosevelt</name>. Some of his bitterest
friends in the journalistic world
allege that it was just a paper knife.</p>

                <p>Last week a number of professional
fortune-tellers were fined at Southend
for having predicted Zeppelins. The
fraudulent nature of their pretensions
was sufficiently manifest, since even the
authorities had been unable to foresee
the coming of the Zeppelins until some
time after they had arrived.</p>

                <p>The export of sardines in oil from
Sweden is prohibited. Some resentment
is felt at the order by the
Germans, who with their customary
ingenuity have for some time been
importing india-rubber sardines in
petrol without detection.</p>

                <p>A soldier at Salonika has sent a live
tortoise home to his relatives at Streatham.
The tortoise, it is understood,
was too fidgety to bear up against its
surroundings and was sent home for
a little excitement.</p>
                <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
                <p>If, on the other hand, the tortoise was
just sent as a souvenir we should discourage
the practice. The tendency on
the part of our soldiers in India and
Egypt to send home elephants and
camels as mementos of the localities
in which they are serving is already
putting something of a strain upon the
postal authorities.</p>

                <p>From "The World of Letters" in
<title>The Observer</title>: "Some day there will
be a cheap edition of Captain Ian Hay's
war book, <title>The First Four Hundred</title>,
and the sale will be immense.... The
Blackwoods are old-fashioned modest
people, who do not parade figures...."
In the present case, however, we do
not think they would have objected to
the reviewer parading a further 99,600
in the title of <name rend="sc">Ian Hay's</name> book.</p>

                <p>"The question of alien waiters in
London hotels rests with those who
patronise the hotels," says a contemporary.
In other words, the pernicious
practice which had grown up before
the War of ordering German waiters
with one's dinner must be abandoned
before the hotel managers will remove
them permanently from their menus.</p>

                <p>Sir <name rend="sc">Frederick Bridge</name> has come
out with a strong denunciation of
"devilry" in German music. How
little we suspected, before the War
opened our deluded eyes, that it was
no mere lack of skill but the fierce
promptings of a demoniac hate that
marred our evenings on the esplanade.</p>

                <p>From The <title>Northern Whig's</title> account
of a visit to the Cruiser Fleet:—"It
was a proud moment when from the
deck of a fast-moving destroyer the long
lines of the mighty Armada, with here
and there the neat little pinnacles
darting in and out, were surveyed."
Obviously a misprint for binnacles.</p>

                <p>All the windows of the V.A.D. hospital
were brilliantly lighted up, and
through them floated the strains of a
piano and occasional bursts of laughter.
Number One Ward, however, was quite
empty except for my friend, Private
McPhee, stalking majestically up and
down as if on sentry go, wearing a "fit
of the blues" several sizes too large for
him and an expression which would,
I believe, be described by kailyard
novelists as "dour."</p>
                <p>"Bong jaw, Mademawselle," he exclaimed,
bringing his stick smartly to
the salute, "or rather bong saw, tae be
correct."</p>
                <p>McPhee has affected the Gallic
tongue since his sojourn in France.</p>
                <p>"Why, what are you doing all by
yourself, McPhee?" I asked. "Are you
on duty?"</p>
                <p>"Na, na," he said, "ah'm pleasin'
masel just."</p>
                <p>He paused and emitted a fierce
chuckle.</p>
                <p>"Ah'm gettin' even," he announced;
"they wantit me to gang oot wi' a
wumman."</p>
                <p>"But whatever made them want you
to do that, McPhee?"</p>
                <p>"One o' thae nurses," continued the
patient smoulderingly. "Ah fought at
Mons, an' Ah fought at New Chapelle,
an' Ah fought at Wipers, that's what
ignorant pairsons ca' Eepers; and they
wantit me to gang oot wi' a wumman.
Why for did they no send me oot to
fight the Jairmans in a peerambulator?"</p>
                <p>"Oh," I said, at last enlightened.
"But surely, McPhee, the nurses are
very nice. And think how hurt they
will be if you won't go out with them."</p>
                <p>"Ah'm no denyin' some o' them are
a' recht," said McPhee grudgingly,
"but it's a maitter o' preenciple. An'
I'm gettin' even wi' them the noo!"</p>
                <p>He chuckled again.</p>
                <p>"But how are you getting even?"</p>
                <p>"Ah'm no dressin' up for them,"
said the vengeful one; "ye ken thae
nurses are havin' a kin' of a bairthday
pairty or the like, an' a' the men's
dressed up to please them. An' if Ah
canna gang oot to please masel, Ah
canna dress oop like a monkeyback to

                <p>"They wantit me to dress up for

argle-barglin' a clock hour tryin' to persuade
me to put thae claes on. 'Oh,

turnit ma face to the wa' an' wouldna

                <p>"Ye ken, the ward that gets the
maist votes gets a prize, an' thae nurses

Ah could ha' won it for Number One.
Fine cud I. Ah can turn masel oot
so's my ain brither couldna tell me from
<name rend="sc">Harry Lauder</name>. But Ah wouldna. If
I canna gang oot——"</p>
                <p>At this point the door opened and a
dejected apparition in a ruff and petticoats,
like a rumpled remnant of a pre-war
pageant, drifted in and sat down
on a bed.</p>
                <p>"Ah weel, Queen Elizabeth, hae
they dune wi' ye yet?" inquired
McPhee sardonically.</p>
                <p>Gloriana shook his head. "They're
playin' musical chairs," he said gloomily,
"so I thought as I wouldn't be missed
for a bit. This thing round my neck
does tickle, but my nurse'd be awful
'urt if I took it off."</p>
                <p>McPhee emitted an ejaculation—Gaelic,
I believe—usually expressed in
writing "Mphm."</p>
                <p>"Sma' things," he said, "please sma'
minds.... Wha won the prize?"</p>
                <p>"Number Two Ward," said Queen
Elizabeth indifferently, "sweets.
They're eatin' 'em. They'll have
stummick-aches to-morrer.... But
there—it's the least as we can do to
let the nurses 'ave their bit o' fun."</p>
                <p>Nurse Robinson hurried up to me on
my way out. I thought her looking a
trifle anxious.</p>
                <p>"I'm feeling rather worried about
one of my men," she began, "Private
McPhee. I wonder if you saw him just
now?"</p>
                <p>"Oh, yes," I said, "we had quite a
long chat."</p>
                <p>"Oh, I'm so glad," she exclaimed,
"I was really quite afraid he was
wrong in his head. Do you know, he
simply refused to dress up for the
party ... and you know how they
love dressing up! Such a good dress,
too—<name rend="sc">Charlie Chaplin</name>.... And I
couldn't get a word out of him! Wasn't
it strange?"</p>
                <p>"Very," I said; "convalescents get
all kinds of fancies, don't they? And
was the party a success?"</p>
                <p>"Splendid!" she said, brightening
up. "Of course it's meant a lot of
work. We've been toiling early and
late at the costumes. But I'm sure
it's worth it. It does please the poor
fellows. Draws them out of themselves,
don't you know."</p>

fight for money, do they? Well, so
we do, and it's a long hard fight, and
it's a good soldier who wins against
that firmly entrenched enemy, the
Command Paymaster.</p>
                    <p>When this War is over I shall take
all my money out of the Bank of England
and, putting it in a paper bag and
not troubling to tie it up, I shall just
hand it to the C.P.M. and say, "Hang
on to this, will you, till I come back?"
Mark my words: if I'm away for fifty
years or so, every penny of it will be
there when I return. It isn't
his habit to part with other
people's money entrusted to
his keeping.</p>
                    <p>I have a sergeant, an honest
upright man with no complications
in his past, except that
he is a Scot by birth and,
happening to be there at the
outbreak, enlisted in Canada.
By reason of his uncertain
movements he is unable to
draw his food in the usual
way, and yet insists, tiresomely,
on being fed. So I
said he'd better feed himself,
and I claimed an authority for
him to draw ration money
in lieu of rations. Having
weathered all the storms of
an administrative correspondence,
we eventually came by
the authority itself. This was
a great and happy day in the
lives of myself and the forty-nine
other officers who had by
this time become involved in
the affair. "Sgt. Blank is
authorised to draw ration
money in lieu of rations as
from March 1st, 1916," I read
to him, and sighed with relief. But it
was a premature sigh. The trouble
was only just beginning.</p>
                    <p>"One-and-eightpence a day, no less,
you get, Sergeant," I said.</p>
                    <p>He was by now an old hand. "One-and-eightpence
a day I am authorized
to get, Sir," he corrected me.</p>
                    <p>A man not easily depressed, he took
a cheerful view of the preliminary
condition that he was paid monthly, in
arrear. He proposed to spend his
meal-times, during the rationless and
moneyless days of March, reading the
correspondence; quite enough to engage
a man's whole attention during at least
that period.</p>
                    <p>April 1st, 1916, duly arrived, and
with it the renewal of the Sergeant's
food question, "What, again?" I
asked, irritably.</p>
                    <p>But the Field Cashier, who was first
approached on April 3rd, wasn't in
the least irritated. The subject interested
him from the start. Moreover,
argumentative by nature though he
undoubtedly was, he was all anxiety to
pay. First, however, there were one or
two trifling formalities to be observed.
"You see," he explained, "I can only
pay out upon an authority."</p>
                    <p>With some confidence and no little
pride we opened our despatch-case
and produced our correspondence. He
read every word of it; his pay corporal
did the same, and very kindly
explained it to us all as he went along.
"This," they agreed, "is your authority
to get the money. What I want is
an authority to pay it." With expressions
of mutual esteem we parted
for the day, agreeing to give the matter
our most earnest consideration during
the week which must elapse before
his return for the next pay-day.</p>
                    <p>We spent a busy week interviewing
the forty-nine officers and anyone else
we could get to listen. Only from the
Camp Commandant did we get anything
approaching enthusiasm. Camp
Commandants are men of a patient
disposition and a never-failing sympathy;
what is better still, they
invariably possess a Sergeant-Major
of unscrupulous if altruistic cunning.
We presented ourselves at the pay-office,
on April 10th, armed with every
possible form of literature, over the
Camp Commandant's signature, which
any reasonable Field Cashier could
possibly want to read.</p>
                    <p>The Field Cashier was very pleased
to see us; we were very pleased to see
him. It was a most happy reunion.
Only the Command Paymaster's presence
was wanted to make the thing
a success. The Field Cashier gave
his address, dispensed with the
Sergeant's presence at all future meetings,
and postponed all further proceedings
in the matter till April 17th.</p>
                    <p>If there was any lack of graciousness
in the correspondence with the C.P.M.,
this was, I must at once say, on my
side. He wanted to oblige, but, being
human, he must have his authority.</p>
                    <p>I sent him the authority to
get and the authority to pay.
His reply was to the effect
that both were perfectly delightful
and in the very best
taste, but what was wanted
before he could authorize payment
was an authority to have
the account in England credited
with the necessary fund.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in my life
I positively loathed England.</p>
                    <p>Bit by bit, however, the
C.P.M. softened; but he
hadn't softened quite enough
to satisfy our Field Cashier by
April 24th. It was not till
May 1st that he gave in altogether,
and went so far as to
send a chit to the Camp Commandant,
authorising him to
receive for me the Sergeant's
money. Meanwhile we had
discovered the private residence
or funk-hole of our
F.C., and conversations became
daily.</p>
                    <p>The defect on May 2nd was
that the Camp Commandant
hadn't signed the right receipt.</p>
                    <p>The defect on May 3rd was
that I hadn't got the right receipt to
sign.</p>
                    <p>The defect on May 4th was—yes,
hunger had got the better of the Sergeant.
Though he had got the right
receipt and signed it, he had signed it
in the wrong place.</p>
                    <p>On May 5th I procured a light lorry,
packed into it the Camp Commandant,
the Sergeant, myself, as many of the
forty-nine officers as I could lure, pens,
ink and paper, and, by mere weight of
numbers, I overcame the Field Cashier.
He scribbled his initials everywhere,
inquired in notes of what value we
would take the money, and undertook,
on his personal honour, that upon his
very next visit to our headquarters
(where the payment should properly be
made) the notes should be ours. I
asked the Sergeant triumphantly what
<pb xml:id="page373" n="pg 373"/>
more he could want. He saluted
emphatically at the prospect of receiving,
on May 8th, the money wherewith
to buy his food for the period March 1st
to April 3rd (inclusive).</p>
                    <p>It was indeed an achievement. Not
only were all authorities in existence
and duly authorised, but the authorities
who had authorised the authorities
were themselves authorised in writing
to do so—and that authoritatively.
However, it was satisfactorily established
in formal proof that all persons
concerned, including the Camp Commandant,
myself and the Sergeant,
were in fact the persons we were represented
to be. Indeed the last lingering
doubt was removed from the mind of
the Field Cashier as to his own identity,
and (hats off, gentlemen!) England had
done her Bit. It was a reluctant bit,
but somehow or other it had been done.
The money was there. The Command
Paymaster could authorise its payment;
the Field Cashier could pay it; the
Camp Commandant could receive it; I
could obtain it; and the Sergeant could
get it. May the 8th was fast approaching
but——</p>
                    <p>If a man (especially when he's right
away in Canada) will be in such a
hurry to enlist that he cannot spare
the time to think out things carefully,
what can he expect? Shortly after
midnight of May 7th to 8th a telegram
arrived: "Reference my A.B.C. 3535;
your X.Y.Z. 97S; their decimal nine
recurring. Please cancel all payment
of rtn. allce. to Sergeant Blank, Akk.
Akk. Akk. This N.C.O. belonging to a
Canadian unit should apply direct to
Paymaster, Overseas Contingent, Akk."</p>
                    <p>The Sergeant said nothing, except to
ask me how long I thought the War
was likely to last?</p>
                    <p>Yours ever,  <name rend="sc">Henry</name>.</p>

                <p>It is no time to waste words in
praise of anybody. We want to give
and mean to give—we may perhaps
even say that we hope to give—the
Cabinet our countenance and some
measure of our approval, but neither
adulation nor encomium. The Editor
of this journal is quite ready to allot the
laurels when they have been earned;
he will be found at his post handing
them out when the time arrives. But
not now.</p>
                <p>It will be said, no doubt ... (Deletion
of what will no doubt be said).</p>
                <p>You may ask a man to put his whole
strength into drawing a cork, but unless
you are a fool you do not, while
the operation is going forward, keep
nagging at him because the cork is too
firmly jammed, nor do you jeer at him
for his lack of prescience in not having
selected a bottle with a wider neck.
You do not ask him strings of useless
questions as to why he doesn't grip
the bottle between his feet or get a
purchase on it with his teeth. Above
all you do not keep handing him tools,
such as a pair of scissors or a button-hook
or a crowbar. No. You concentrate
earnestly upon the provision of an
<title>efficient corkscrew</title>, if you ever hope to
taste the imprisoned liquor. And meanwhile,
"Don't trip him up" should be
the order of the day; "Don't catch
his eye" should be your watchword;
"Don't get into the bowler's arm"
should be your motto.</p>
                <p>We shall be told, of course ...
(Deletion of what we shall of course
be told).</p>
                <p>But to discountenance nagging is
not to encourage laudation, adulation,
or encomium, or even praise. These
can wait. The cow, to change the
metaphor, will generally give her milk
all the better if she is not in the act of
being stroked or patted or wreathed
with buttercups.</p>
                <p>We shall perhaps evoke the retort ...
(Deletion of the retort, which will
perhaps be evoked).</p>
                <p>So much for the exact attitude which
the Public ought to maintain toward
the Government during the War. Unfortunately
the Public, or rather a
section of them, have done nothing of
the sort. And that is the reason why,
in spite of good intentions about
adulation and all that, it has become
absolutely necessary for us to step
forward and present the Ministry
with this unsolicited testimonial. The
Government is not what it appears
to be to cross-grained critics seeking
for a Rotation of suitable scapegoats.
Ministers are full of glaring faults.
Most of them before the War were
wickedly engaged in doing all sorts of
damage to the country, appalling to
contemplate. But since the War began
they are doing what they can to retrieve
a lurid past, and we believe that History
(our intimate colleague who waits
to endorse at a later stage the views
expressed in these columns) will pronounce
that they have displayed great
qualities.</p>
                <p>But stay! We are in danger of adulation
after all. Let us freely admit that
they are a sorry lot. We have never
been blind to the fact. All the same,
they have shown the greatest of all
qualities in a crisis—dispassion almost
amounting to torpor. There has never
been about them the slightest trace of
hustle or helter-skelter. They have
steered with the greatest deliberation a
course which they thought was the
right one for the ship of state to take.
To change the metaphor, having fixed
the route of the national 'bus they have
refrained from diving down side-streets.
(But there we go again, running off
into laudation. This will not do at all.)</p>
                <p>To speak frankly, all the political
tenets of the majority of the Cabinet
are such as can never receive anything
but bitter hostility from this publication.
We can't help it. There is a
gulf fixed, that is how it comes about.
But on the other hand we must not
let this view prevent us—even though,
after all, we are guilty of eulogy—from
recognising their sterling worth. They
are indispensable to the navigation of
the ship of state. To change the
metaphor, we must be content to let
the train be driven by the engine-driver
and not insist upon interference by the
dining-car attendant.</p>
                <p>We are well aware that we lay ourselves
open to the charge ... (Deletion
of the charge to which we lay
ourselves open).</p>
                <p>Let us then trust the Government,
even blindly. Let our motto be the
immortal words in the "Hunting of the
Snark": "<title>They had often, the Bellman
said, saved them from wreck: though
none of the sailors knew how.</title>"</p>

                <head>THE HAPPY ERROR.</head>
                <p>As a rule I am not one to peer over
shoulders and read other people's letters
or papers. But when one is in a queue
waiting for one's passport to be <title>viséd</title>,
and when one has been there for an
hour and still seems no nearer to the
promised land, and when it is the
second time in the day that one has
been in a queue for the same purpose—once
in France and once in England—why,
some little deflection from the
narrow path of perfect propriety may
be forgiven.</p>
                <p>Moreover in other ways I behaved
better than many of my fellow-travellers,
for I stood loyally behind the
man in front of me in my due place,
and did not, as others did, insinuate
myself from the side into positions
to which, by all the laws of precedence
and decency, they were disentitled.
Indeed I even caught myself wondering
whether, had I any preferential opportunities
of getting through first, as some
Red Cross and otherwise influential
people had, I should make use of them.
To take any advantage of this weary
waiting line of suspects, of which I
was one, would have been almost
monstrous.</p>
                <p>So, standing there all patiently and
dejected, moving forward a foot or so
every four or five minutes, no wonder
that I found myself reading the embarkation
paper which the gentleman
in front of me had filled up and was
holding so legibly before him.</p>
                <p>He was tall and solid and calm and
French, with a better cut coat than
most Frenchmen, even the aristocrats,
trouble about. He was broad-shouldered
and erect, and I was piqued to find
him, for all his iron-grey hair, five
years younger than myself. His name
was—never mind; but I know it. His
profession was given as publicist—as
though he were Mr. <name rend="sc">Arnold White</name> or
Sir <name rend="sc">Henry Norman</name>, although, for all I
know, Sir <name rend="sc">Henry Norman</name> may by now
be a Brigadier-General. His reasons
for visiting England, given in English,
were in connection with his profession.
But after that his English broke down;
for when it came to the question what
was his sex, how do you think he had
answered it? I consider that his solution
of the difficulty was an ample
reward to me—and to you, if you too
have any taste in terminological exactitude—for
my fracture of a social
convention. The word he had wanted
was either "male" or "masculine";
but they had evaded him. He had
then cast about for English terminology
associated with men, and had thought
vaguely of master and mister. The
result was that the line ran thus:—"Sex:
Masterly."</p>
                <p>And, looking at the publicist's <title>soigné</title>
moustache and firm jaw and broad
hands, I could believe it. But what an
inspiration! And, dear me! what will
the Panks, if there are any left, say?</p>

                <head>IDENTIFICATION.</head>
                <p>How often the kind of thing occurs
that I am about to describe!</p>
                <p>Four or five summers ago, before
the world went mad, I was on one of
<name rend="sc">David MacBrayne's</name> steamers on the
way to a Scotch island. Among the
few passengers was an interesting man,
with whom I fell into conversation.
He was a vigorous, bulky, very tall
man, with a pointed grey beard and a
mass of grey hair under a panama, and
he was bound, he told me, for a well-known
fishing-lodge, whither he went
every August. He had been a great
traveller and knew Persia well; he had
also been in Parliament, and one of his
sons was in the siege of Mafeking. So
much I remember of his affairs; but
his name I did not learn. We talked
much about books, and I put him on
to <name rend="sc">Doughty's</name>
                    <title>Arabia Deserta</title>.</p>
                <p>I have often thought of him since
and wondered who he was, and whenever
I have met fishermen or others
likely to be acquainted with this attractive
and outstanding personality I have
asked about him; but never with success.
And then last week I seemed really to be
on the track, for I found that my new
neighbour in the country has also had
the annual custom of spending a fortnight
or so in the same Scotch island,
and he claims to know everyone who
ever visits that retired spot.</p>
                <p>So this is what happened.</p>
                <p>"If you're so old an islander as
that," I said, "you're the very person
to solve the problem that I have carried
about for four or five years. There's
a man who fishes regularly up there"—and
then I described my fellow-passenger.
"Tell me," I said, "who he is."</p>
                <p>He considered, knitting his brows.</p>
                <p>"You're sure you're right in saying
he is unusually tall?" he inquired at
last.</p>
                <p>"Absolutely," I replied.</p>
                <p>"That's a pity," he said, "because
otherwise it might be Sir <name rend="sc">Gerald Orpington</name>.
Only he's short. Still, he was
in Parliament right enough. But, of
course, if it was a tall man it's not
Orpington."</p>
                <p>He considered again.</p>
                <p>"You say," he remarked, "that he
had been in Persia? Now old Jack
Beresford is tall enough and has
plenty of hair, but I swear he's never
been to Persia, and of course he hasn't
a son at all. It's very odd. Describe
him again."</p>
                <p>I described my man again, and he
followed every point on his fingers.</p>
                <p>"Well," he said, "I could have sworn
I knew every man who ever fished at
Blank, but this fellow—— Oh, wait a
minute! You say he is tall and bulky
and had travelled, and his son was in
the Boer War, and he has been in
Parliament? Why, it must be old
Carstairs. And yet it can't be. Carstairs
was never married and was never
in Parliament."</p>
                <p>He pondered again.</p>
                <p>Then he said, "You're sure it wasn't
a clean-shaven bald man with a single
eyeglass?"</p>
                <p>"Quite," I said.</p>
                <p>"Because," he went on, "if he had
been it would have been old Peterson
to the life."</p>
                <p>"He wasn't bald or clean-shaven," I
said.</p>
                <p>"You're sure he said Blank?" he
inquired after another interval of profound
thought.</p>
                <p>"Absolutely," I replied.</p>
                <p>"Tell me again what he was like.
Tell me exactly. I know every one up
there; I must know him."</p>
                <p>"He was a vigorous, bulky, very tall
man," I said, "with a pointed beard
and a mass of grey hair under a
panama; and he went to Blank every
August. He had been a great traveller
and knew Persia; he had been in
Parliament, and one of his sons was
in the siege of Mafeking."</p>
                <p>"I don't know him," he said.</p>

                        <hi rend="sc">Sir</hi>,—I am encouraged by reading
the very interesting letter which appeared
in your issue of May 29th under
the heading, "Biology at the Front,"
and dealt with the habit acquired by
French poultry of imitating the sound
of flying shells, to relate an experience
which recently befell me. I was seated
at breakfast "Somewhere in France,"
and had ordered, as is my custom, a
boiled egg. When it was brought to
me I proceeded to open it by giving it
a smart tap. The egg immediately
exploded with a loud report, and the
contents were scattered in all directions.
Those at table with me at once threw
themselves prostrate on the ground,
and one, whose olfactory nerves were
excessively developed, exhibited every
symptom of being gassed. On questioning
the innkeeper we learnt that
the egg had been laid some weeks
before by a hen in the neighbourhood
of the Front. I had previously noticed
that it was elongated in shape, the
small end being pointed and the base
end nearly flat, while the whole was
cased in a shell.</p>
                    <p>The continuance of this imitative
habit would be a strange perpetual
memorial of the Great War—particularly
for Pacificist politicians.</p>

                    <p>
                        <title>Monday, May 29th.</title>—When Mr.
<name rend="sc">Anderson</name> alleged that a certain firm,
desirous of getting its employés exempted,
had "hospitably entertained"
the members of the local tribunal at
its works, we felt that we were on
the fringe of a grave scandal. A picture
of the tribunal replete with salmon
and champagne rose before the
mind's eye. But when we learned from
the Ministerial reply that the refreshment
alluded to consisted of "tea and
bread-and-butter" the vision faded
away. Those innocent viands could not
connote corruption.</p>
                    <p>
                        <title>À propos</title> of tribunals, the House
learned with delight that the military
representative at Middlesbrough is Mr.
<name rend="sc">Hustler Hustler</name>. Obviously the
Government have at last discovered
"the man of push and go" for whom
they were looking a year ago.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">McKenna</name> was a little short-tempered
this afternoon. He first
descended heavily upon Mr. <name rend="sc">Samuel
Samuel</name>, who had suggested that it
was time to issue another War Loan,
instead of borrowing so heavily upon
Treasury Bills. The hon. member, he
declared, had no right to speak for
that mysterious entity, "the City."
When Sir F. <name rend="sc">Banbury</name>, who indubitably
has that right, endorsed Mr. <name rend="sc">Samuel's</name>
appeal, Mr. <name rend="sc">McKenna</name> took refuge under
a point of order—rather an exiguous
form of shelter for a Minister of the
Crown.</p>

                        <title>Tuesday, May 30th.</title>—The uncertainty
of the Volunteers as to whether they
are regarded by the War Office as a
very present help in time of trouble or
as a confounded nuisance will hardly
be removed by Lord <name rend="sc">Kitchener's</name>
speech. True he said many nice things
about them, and particularly about the
behaviour of the Dublin corps during
the insurrection, but when it came to a
tangible recognition of their usefulness
he had very little to offer. All the
money available was required for the
Army. The Volunteers must be content
with such part-worn equipment
and old-fashioned weapons as he could
find them.</p>
                    <p>On the Consolidated Fund Bill
Mr. <name rend="sc">Fell</name> and other Members for East
Anglia represented very poignantly the
woes inflicted upon their constituencies
by the air and sea raids. Fishermen
and lodging-house keepers were alike
deprived of their livelihood. Could not
the Government do something for them,
either by billeting soldiers or by direct
grants-in-aid?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">Hayes Fisher</name> in reply exuded
sympathy at every pore. The previous
speakers had, as he said, painted "a
deplorable picture of gloom," and he
laid on the colours from an even more
opulent palette. But on the question
of actual relief he was painfully indefinite.
Billeting—that was a question
for the War Office; grants—they
were a matter for the Treasury. The
East Anglers who thought their fish
safely hooked had to go away empty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <title>Wednesday, May 31st.</title>—Not content
with having laid sacrilegious hands on
the clock, the Government have now
deranged the calendar and kicked Whit-Monday
into August. But it is all in
the good cause of piling up shells
against the Bosches, so the House
cheerfully approved the <name rend="sc">Prime Minister's</name>
announcement.</p>
                    <p>For some days there have been
rumours of an impending attack upon
Lord <name rend="sc">Kitchener</name>, to be led by Colonel
<name rend="sc">Churchill</name>. Perhaps that was why
Mr. <name rend="sc">Tennant</name>, who moved the Vote
for the War Office, decided to get his
blow in first. His short speech began
with a jibe at his critic's strategical
omniscience, though it is not true
that he referred to him as "the right
hon. and recently gallant gentleman";
<pb xml:id="page379" n="pg 379"/>
proceeded with a denial of most of his
assumptions, and ended with a high
tribute to <name rend="sc">Lord Kitchener's</name> prevision
in raising a great army to cope with a
long war.</p>
                    <p>Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name> did not pick up
the gage thus ostentatiously thrown
down, but some of his friends were less
discreet, and developed a close-range
assault upon <name rend="sc">Lord Kitchener</name>. The
<name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name> is never seen to greater
advantage than when he is defending a
colleague, and he declared that the
<name rend="sc">War Secretary</name> was personally entitled
to the credit for the amazing expansion
of the army.</p>
                    <p>Unofficial tributes were not wanting.
Sir <name rend="sc">Mark Sykes</name> asserted that in Germany
the <name rend="sc">War Secretary</name> was feared
as a great organiser, while in the East
his name was one to conjure with;
and Sir <name rend="sc">George Reid</name> declared that
his chief fault was that he was "not
clever at circulating the cheap coin of
calculated civilities which enable inferior
men to rise to positions to which
they are not entitled."</p>
                    <p>
                        <title>Thursday, June 1st</title>.—In moving that
the House should at its rising adjourn
until June 20th, the <name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name>
felt it necessary to remove any impression
that the Government, while asking
everybody else to sacrifice their Whitsun
holiday, were themselves going
junketing.</p>
                    <p>Like Old <name rend="sc">Tom Morris</name>, who rebuked
a would-be Sunday golfer by saying
"if you don't want your Sabbath rest
the links do," he pointed out that the
continuous sittings of the House threw
a double burden not only upon Ministers—one
of whom, Mr. <name rend="sc">Runciman</name>, has
unhappily broken down—but also upon
the permanent officials. Even Members
of Parliament, he slily added,
might be under a misapprehension in
supposing that constant attendance at
the House was the best way in which
they could discharge their duty to their
country in time of war.</p>
                    <p>The Nationalist Members are doing
their best to "give <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name> a
chance." True, they ask an inordinate
number of questions arising out of the
hot Easter week in Dublin—when, according
to the local wit, it was "'98 in
the shade"—but otherwise they have
sternly repressed any tendency to factiousness.
Yesterday, when a freelance
sought to move the adjournment
of the House in order to denounce the
continuance of martial law in Ireland,
not a single other Member rose to support
him; and to-day, though Mr.
<name rend="sc">Dillon</name> could not resist the temptation
to make a speech on the same subject,
he showed a refreshing restraint.</p>
                    <p>Only once—when he declared that
"if you can reach the hearts of the
Irish people you can do anything with
them; but they will not be driven, and
you cannot crush them"—did his voice
approach that painfully high pitch
which irreverent critics have been
known to describe as "Sister Mary
Jane's top-note."</p>
                    <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">Asquith</name> in reply was sympathetic
but firm. The Government were
not deaf to the plea for leniency which
had been addressed to them by all Irish
representatives, by Sir <name rend="sc">Edward Carson</name>
as well as by Mr. <name rend="sc">Redmond</name>. But they
could not give an undertaking that
there should be an end of the courts-martial.
As for the persons deported
from Ireland, for whom Mr. <name rend="sc">Dillon</name>
had specially appealed, it would be
more humane in their own interests
not to bring them to trial at once, for
that would mean a crop of convictions
and sentences which would increase
instead of allaying the alleged irritation
in Ireland.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">John O'Connor</name> developed a
really ingenious argument. To show
that martial law ought now to be
dropped he mentioned that if he attempted
to hold a recruiting meeting
in his constituency his life would not
be worth half-an-hour's purchase.
Members who were thinking of spending
the recess in Ireland were greatly
impressed.</p>

                        <title>Sir Geoffrey Pomfret</title>, "that almighty

the same divine right over the
souls of his village that he exercised, in

think, has brought the present War
more closely home to my bosom than
the humours of this feudal relic—taken
in all seriousness by everyone,
including the author. It seems almost
inconceivable that Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell</name>'s play
deals with conditions that still survived
only a few years ago. Yet the Squire's
devotion to the science of eugenics
establishes its date as quite recent. It
was his sole taint of modernity; and
indeed where his own son's marriage
was concerned he omitted to apply his
scientific principles, and made a choice
for him in which no regard was paid to
eugenics, but only to established social
traditions.</p>
                    <p>At first the play opened up prospects
of a pleasant gaiety. A love scene,
conducted in a rich Western brogue,
between the <title>Squire</title>'s footman and his
still-room maid, and the embarrassment
caused by her eagerness to learn the
philosophy of "eujanics," were full of
promise. It was confirmed by the appearance
of Mr. <name rend="sc">Ainley</name>, whose manner
reminded us of his many triumphs in
the art of eccentric detachment. His
part—the title-rôle—was that of <title>Sir
Geoffrey's</title> faithful butler, on such
familiar, though respectful, terms with
his master that the two sipped port
together in the former's room in broad
daylight while discussing family matters.
They took an unconscionable
time about it, but, as I said, it promised
well. However, Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell</name> had
other designs than our mere amusement.
We were not to have our comedy
without paying for it with our heart's
blood. Very soon the shadow of melodramatic
pathos and mystery crept
over the sunny scene. <title>Fishpingle</title> takes
a box from a cupboard and glances at
a miniature and a bundle of letters.
There is illegitimacy in the air, and a
lady near me in the stalls confides to
her neighbour that "he's the <title>Squire's</title>
half-brother." I can't think where she
got her information, for the rest of us
never learned the facts of the mystery
till the very end of the evening, and
even then the details of <title>Fishpingle's</title>
origin only transpired (as they say)
under extreme pressure arising out of
his dismissal by his master on the
strength of a violent disagreement
about fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>
                        <title>Sir Geoffrey's</title> father, it seems, had
before his marriage run away with a
girl not of his own rank, who had
generously refused to spoil the family
tree by marrying him; and <title>Fishpingle</title>
was the result. You might judge from
the peculiarity of his surname that
the matter was taken lightly by his
parents. But you would be wrong.
His mother died when he was born,
and his first name (for I cannot call it a
Christian name) was <title>Benoni</title>, which,
being interpreted, means "the child of
sorrow." <title>Sir Geoffrey's</title> grandmother,
who had discouraged the legal adjustment
of the relationship between the
lovers, had tried to repair matters by
educating <title>Fishpingle</title> above the obscurity
of his irregular birth; hence
his comparative erudition, rare in a
butler.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Now the opening of the play had
put me into a mood which was not
the right one for the reception of this
extract from a deplorable past. Some
comedies would be all the better for a
little tragic relief; but this was too
much. Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell</name> had no business
to give his play a title like <title>Fishpingle</title>.
He should have called it "Nature's
Nobleman, or The Tragical Romance
of a Faithful Butler's Birth," and then
I might have known what to expect.
As it was I felt aggrieved. It was not,
of course, a question of asking for my
money back at the doors (critics, to be
just to them, never do this in the case
of a complimentary seat), but I felt I
had a right to protest against this
attempt to harrow my heart-strings,
attuned as they were to the key of
comedy, with a painful drama dating
back to more than half a century before
the rise of the curtain, and with its
chief actors all dead. And the irritating
mystery in which it was
wrapped only made things worse. Further,
I suffered a considerable strain
on both my head and my heart in consequence
of obscure hints (vaguely involving
a photograph on his mantelpiece)
as to the reason why <title>Fishpingle</title>
remained a bachelor to the bitter end.</p>
                    <p>But I am ashamed to appear flippant,
for Mr. <name rend="sc">Ainley</name> played with exquisite
feeling and a fine sincerity. And I
have to thank Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell</name> for giving
us some excellent studies of character—not
character developed before our
eyes by circumstance (except perhaps
a little at the last), but admirably observed
as a kind of fixture to be taken
with the house.</p>
                    <p>And if the play is not quite on the
high level of Mr. <name rend="sc">Galsworthy's</name>
                        <title>The
Eldest Son</title>, which it faintly recalls, it is
much more worthy of Mr. <name rend="sc">Vachell's</name>
gifts than the poor thing, <title>Penn</title>, which
died so young. Also he is very much
more fortunate this time in his cast.
Miss <name rend="sc">Marion Terry</name>, as <title>Lady Pomfret</title>,
was a pattern of sweet graciousness;
and Mr. <name rend="sc">Allan Aynesworth</name> was at his
happiest as <title>Sir Geoffrey</title>. And the two
pairs of lovers, Mr. <name rend="sc">Cyril Raymond</name>
and Miss <name rend="sc">Maud Bell</name> above stairs, and
Mr. <name rend="sc">Reginald Bach</name> and Miss <name rend="sc">Doris
Lytton</name> below (they were really all of
them on the ground floor, the butler's
room being the common trysting-place),
served as delightful examples of natural
selection—both on their own part and
that of the management—and were as
fresh and healthy as the most eugenical
could desire.</p>

                    <head>"Daddy Long-Legs."</head>
                    <p>
                        <title>Daddy Long-Legs</title> is a pleasant
American sentimental comedy made by
<name rend="sc">Jean Webster</name> out of her very jolly
book, and not so sticky as some of our
importations of the same general type.
The four Acts are phases in the development
of <title>Judy</title> (or <title>Jerusha</title>) <title>Abbott</title>,
orphan; and, as normally happens in
book-plays, development is extremely
abrupt. Act I. shows us <title>Judy</title> as the
drudge of the orphanage breaking into
flame of rebellion on the day of the
visit of the trustees. Naturally the
trustees are all trustees <title>pour rire</title>, except
one real good rich man, <title>Jervis
Pendleton</title>, who admires the orphan's
spirit, and decides that she is to have
her chance at his charges; but is on
no account to know her benefactor.</p>
                    <p>In Act II., a year later, <title>Judy</title> is not
merely the most popular but the best
dressed girl in her college. She still
dreams about her unknown benefactor,
whom she calls <title>Daddy Long-Legs</title>,
<pb xml:id="page381" n="pg 381"/>
and assumes to be a hoary old man.
<title>Pendleton</title> comes to Commem., or its
equivalent, to have a peep at his ward,
and loses his heart. In the Third Act,
three years later, our heroine is a
famous author, and <title>Pendleton</title>, coming
(still incog.) to propose, is refused by a
<title>Judy</title> who has taken to worrying unduly
(and not altogether convincingly, if you
ask me) about her lack of family. And,
of course, in Act IV., wedding bells.</p>
                    <p>Miss <name rend="sc">Renée Kelly</name> has a charming
personality, and a smile which alone is
worth going to see. She trounced the
matron and the incredible trustees with
a fierce fury, and seemed to have easy
command of the changes of mood and
tense which her fast-moving circumstances
required. A pretty twinkling
star. Mr. <name rend="sc">Charles Waldron</name> is a
skilful actor. If he, perhaps, grimaced
a little too much by way of not letting
us miss the obvious points of the little
mystery, he made as admirable a proposal
of marriage as I have ever heard
on the stage (or off it for that matter,
with perhaps one exception); but to
suppose that so accomplished a lover
would accept a mere mournful shake
of the head as a final refusal is simply
too absurd. Miss <name rend="sc">Fay Davis</name> made
quite a little triumph of gentle gracious
kindliness out of one of those potentially
tiresome explanatory parts without
which no mystifications can be
contrived. Miss <name rend="sc">Kate Jepson</name> is a
comédienne of rich grain, and gave
a very amusing study of the hero's
old nurse. Miss <name rend="sc">Jean Gadell</name>, that
clever specialist in dour unpleasant
stage women, made a properly repulsive
thing out of the matron of the
orphanage. Mr. <name rend="sc">Hylton Allen</name> scored
his points as a comic lover with droll
effect. If the distinctly clever children
of the home (<title>Judy</title> excepted) had been
effectively put on the contraband list I
should not have worried. They were
unduly noisy (for art, not for life perhaps),
and they overdid their parts,
being not only rowdy in the absence,
and abject in the presence, of authority,
but different kinds of children—not
merely the same children in two moods.</p>
                    <p>Altogether a pleasant play pleasantly

"We give these things long words. We talk of the 'triumph
of organisation.' Is it not simpler to say—that when a man knows
exactly what he wants done, exactly how every part of it should be
done, and can pick a man for each task, and apportion his requirements
to what is possible; and then, by far the most important thing
of all, can so deal with the many under his command that each is
most furiously anxious to do what the leader wants—why then,
things go right."—<title>Westminster Gazette.</title>

                <head>THE GREAT NEUTRAL.</head>
                <p>I am the Neutral Journalist who
wanders round Europe. I am absolutely
impartial. I am absolutely
trustworthy. My perfect integrity is
vouched for at the head of all my
articles. Pleasant it is to come over to
London, sell one set of articles to the
Boom Press and another to the Gloom
Press, and then sit down with smiling
face and begin an article for Germany:
"I sit in a hovel amongst the ruins of
Fleet Street, with the wreck of the
armoured fort of St. Paul's in view. I
hear a stir outside. A wild mob of
conscientious objectors is beating a recruiting
officer to death. Such things
happen hourly in defeated Albion."
My series of London, Liverpool, Manchester
and Birmingham—all in ashes—has
proved so successful that I propose
to cover all the large towns and
construct a Baedeker of ruins.</p>
                <p>Yet I pride myself more on my work
for England's Press. My German
articles have all to be in the same
vein. Only the Boom Press exists in
Germany. But in England one can
vary one's view and do artistic work.
You must have read my story of the
struggle for the last sausage in a Frankfort
butcher's shop—how the troops intervened
and the crowd attacked them,
and how ultimately 1,400 civilians
were mown down with machine guns—and
the sausage was eaten by the
General Officer commanding the Army
Corps that suppressed the rising. You
must also have seen my description
of the <name rend="sc">Kaiser</name>—his white hair, bent
shoulders, deathlike look as he passed,
protected by his Guards from the wild
fury of the Berlin mob. Of course I
have another <name rend="sc">Kaiser</name>, the bright smiling
man whose youth seems to have been
renewed by the War, who waves his
hand to the madly enthusiastic crowds
waiting round the Palace for a glimpse
of their divinity.</p>
                <p>You must have read my secret interviews
with distinguished Germans, who
whispered to me that <name rend="sc">Hindenburg</name> had
thrown down his sword and declared
that if the useless slaughter did not
cease he would march on Berlin. I
have told you their promises of bloody
revolutions and fierce risings. Also I
have given you interviews with other
distinguished Germans, who confided
to me that now Germany could turn
out one submarine and one Zeppelin
every week-day and two on Sundays,
and I have thrilled you with the details
of the great trade war which will come
directly peace is declared, when Germany
will win back all her wealth
by selling everything fifty per cent.
below cost.</p>
                <p>How my dinners vary in that strange
Teutonic land! I pay twenty marks
for two tiny slices of fish, a thin piece
of indigestible potato bread, and a
section of rancid sausage. At other
times I spend two marks and get a
delightful meal which could not be
procured in a London restaurant for
five shillings. I walk through Berlin
and see scarcely a cripple or a wounded
man. I let you know that ninety-five
per cent. of German wounded,
owing to the skill of German doctors,
go back to the Front in a week. To
other English readers I confide that
all the maimed, wounded and blind
are sent into the very centre of Germany.
There are huge districts without

have increased in the
War are the neutral journalists.</p>

                    <p>In <title>Hearts of Alsace</title> (<name rend="sc">Smith, Elder</name>) your interest will be
held less by the actual story than by the profoundly moving
and poignant picture that Miss <name rend="sc">Betham-Edwards</name> has
drawn of life in the Reichsland under the increasing burden
of Prussian tyranny. It is a picture that one feels to be
absolutely true. The author writes of what she knows.
This Alsatian family—old <title>Jean Barthélemy</title>, the city father,
crushed and embittered by the fate of his loved Mulhouse;
his two daughters and the circle of their friends within the
town—all live and move and look longingly towards the
West, as so many others must have done these forty and
odd years past. The plot, what there is of it, concerns  the
clandestine love of <title>Claire</title>, the petted younger daughter of
the Gley house, for an officer in the conqueror's host, whom
she had met during a visit to Strasburg. <title>Claire</title> marries
her <title>Kurt</title>, a shady worthless
knave, and, as the
book ends with the outbreak
of war, is left to an
unknown fate. Very stirring
are the chapters that
tell of the tumult of emotion
that broke loose when the
French guns were heard in
Mulhouse; though here—as
in all those war stories
whose only satisfactory
end is the final confusion
of Kaiserdom—one feels
that there is a chapter
yet to be added. Miss
<name rend="sc">Betham-Edwards</name> writes
with all the vigour (I
might add all the garrulity)
of intense personal feeling.
Her book, as a race study,
is a real contribution to

                    <p>These are days in which
some measure of sacrifice
is rightly considered the
common duty of everyone,
so long as it is sacrifice
with an object.  Perhaps this consideration gives
me less patience with the preposterous kind, which, as
a motive in fiction, usually consists in the hero inviting
all and sundry to trample upon his prospects and reputation.
This is what the chief character in <title>Proud Peter</title>
(<name rend="sc">Hutchinson</name>) did. He began by allowing it to be supposed
that he was the father of his brother's illegitimate child,
the bright peculiar fatuousness of which pretence was that
thereby the said brother was enabled to marry, and break
the heart of, the heroine, whom, of course, Peter himself
adored. Also, many years after, when the child, now an
objectionable young man, nay more, an actor, was pursuing
another heroine with his unwelcome attentions, he very
nearly spiked <title>Peter's</title> guns, on being threatened, by exclaiming,
"I am thy son"—or words to that effect. Fortunately,
however, there existed, as I had somehow known would be
the case, a signed photograph that put all that right.
Why, I wonder, is Mr. W. E. <name rend="sc">Norris</name> always so sharp
with the dramatic profession? Was it not in one of his
earlier stories that somebody quite seriously questions
whether a good actor can also be a good man? On the
whole, as you may have gathered, while I should call
Proud Peter a comfortable tale of the eupeptic type, I
enjoyed it rather less than other stories from the same
facile pen.</p>

                        <title>The Story of a Prisoner of War</title>
(<name rend="sc">Chatto and Windus</name>) can be recommended to all who
can still digest the uncooked facts. "I can swear," he
says, "that all that is written is Gospel truth," but
without any such assurance it would be impossible for
even the most sceptical to doubt the writer's honesty.
Wounded and taken prisoner in August, 1914, he suffered
severely at the hands of the Germans, and his account of
the camp at Wittenburg does nothing to decrease one's
loathing for that pestilential spot. For many reasons
it gives that a civilized race can sink to such depths of
cruelty and cowardice. Perhaps the only people to whom
it will give any comfort are those who have sent food and
clothing to our prisoners.
But I am glad that this
book came my way, because
I would choose to
read facts of the War
baldly written by a soldier
rather than any war fiction
composed by imaginative
civilians. "Of course
I'm not an author," he
writes, and as far as grammar
and spelling go it is
not for me to contradict
him, but he has seen and
suffered, and in these days
no one who has handled
a bayonet need apologise
for taking a turn with a
pen.</p>

                    <p>Encouraged, no doubt,
by the reception accorded
to that cheery little volume,
<title>Minor Horrors of
War</title>, its author, Dr. A.
E. <name rend="sc">Shipley</name>, has now followed
it with an equally
entertaining sequel in More
Minor Horrors (<name rend="sc">Smith</name>,
<name rend="sc">Elder</name>). This deals more especially with the pests attached
to the Senior Service, and familiar to those who go down to
the sea in ships—the Cockroach, the Mosquito, the Rat,
the Biscuit-Weevil and others. Of each Dr. <name rend="sc">Shipley</name> has
some pleasant word of instruction or comment to say, in
his own highly entertaining manner. I like, for example,
his remark about the mosquito (whose infinite variety is
recognised in no fewer than five chapters), that, if he could
talk, the burden of his song would be that of the guests at
the dinner-party in <title>David Copperfield</title>—"Give us blood!"
And I found good omen in the cockroach world on learning
that <title>Periplaneta Orientalis</title>, or the common English sort,
has <title>P. Germanica</title> thoroughly beat in the matter of empire-building.
In short, Dr. <name rend="sc">Shipley's</name> second volume, like his
first, combines instruction with amusement, and is well
worth its modest eighteen-pence to those on land who may
wish to learn about the intimate associates of their dear
ones who are defending them upon the sea.</p>
