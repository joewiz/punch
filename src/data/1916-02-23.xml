                <head>MY WAR STORIES.</head>
                <p>Did you ever try to write War stories? I am not
alluding to Press telegrams from Athens, Amsterdam or
Copenhagen, but legitimate magazine fiction. Once I
was reasonably competent and could rake in my modest
share of War profits. But recently Clibbers, of the International
Fiction Syndicate, approached me and said, "Old
man, do me some War stuff. Anything you like, but it
must have a novel climax."</p>
                <p>"Not in a War story," I protested.</p>
                <p>"Can you deliver the goods?" said Clibbers sternly.</p>
                <p>After that what could I do but alter the stories I had in
stock.</p>
                <p>For example there was my fine story, "Retrieved." The
innocent convict (would that I had the happy innocence
of the convict of fiction!) emerges from Portmoor. In a few
well-chosen words the genial old prison governor (to avoid
libel actions I hasten to say that no allusion is made to
any living person) advises the released man to make a
new career. The convict marches to the recruiting office
and enlists. In a couple of paragraphs he is at the Front;
on the second page he saves the Colonel's life, captures a
German trench on page three, and in less time than it takes
to do it gains the V.C., discovers the villain dying repentant
with a full confession in his left puttee, and embraces the
girl who chanced to be Red-Crossing in the rear of the
German position—presumably having arrived there by
aeroplane. This seemed to me both probable and credible
in a magazine. Still a novel climax was needed. After the
few well-chosen words from the prison governor I took the
convict to the nearest public-house, let him discover that
the new restrictions were in force, and brought the story
to a novel conclusion by making him say with oaths to the
recruiting officer that he would be jiggered if ever he
formed fours for such a rotten old country.</p>
                <p>I thought that, at any rate, I had provided one surprise
for my readers. Then I turned to my psychological
study, entitled "The Funk." There wasn't much story
in this, but a good deal about a man's sensations when in
danger. I could picture the horror of it from personal
experience, for my rear rank man has nearly brained me
a dozen times when the specials have bayonet drill (I
also have nearly brained—but I am wandering from the
subject). Well, the Funk at the critical moment ran away,
but, being muddled by German gas clouds, ran straight into
the German lines. He thought that people were trying
to intercept his flight. In panic he cut them down.
At the last moment he cut the <name rend="sc">Crown Prince's</name> smile in
twain. (In fiction, mark you, it is quite allowable to put
the <name rend="sc">Crown Prince</name> into the firing line). Then came glory,
the D.C.M. and a portrait of some one else with the
Funk's name attached in <title>The Daily Snap</title>. However,
novelty was needed. I concluded by leaving the Funk
hiding in a dug-out when the British charged and eating
the regiment's last pot of strawberry jam.</p>
                <p>I turned to another romance, entitled "Secret Service,"
and found to my joy that this needed very little alteration.
The hero chanced to be in Germany at the outset of the
war. He was imprisoned at Ruhleben, Potsdam, Dantzic,
Frankfort and Wilhelmshaven. He escaped from these
places by swimming the Rhine (thrice), the Danube, the
Meuse, the Elbe, the Vistula, the Bug, the Volga, the Kiel
Canal and Lake Geneva. He chloroformed, sandbagged,
choked and gagged sentinels throughout the length and
breadth of Germany. From under a railway carriage seat
he overheard a conversation between <name rend="sc">Enver Bey</name> and
<name rend="sc">Bernhardi</name>. Concealed beneath a pew at a Lutheran
church he heard <name rend="sc">Count Zep.</name> and <name rend="sc">von Tirp.</name> exchanging
deadly secrets. Finally he emerged from a grandfather's
clock as the <name rend="sc">Kaiser</name> was handing the <name rend="sc">Crown Prince</name> some
immensely important documents, snatched them, stole an
aeroplane, bombed a Zeppelin or two on his homeward
way, and landed exhausted at Lord <name rend="sc">Kitchener's</name> feet.
Here came the change. Instead of opening the parcel to
discover the plans of the German staff, the <name rend="sc">War Secretary</name>
found in his hand this document:—</p>
                <p>"Sausage Prices in Berlin: Pork Sausage, 3 marks 80 pf.;
Horse Sausage, 3 marks 45 pf.; Dog Sausage, 2 marks 95 pf.
Gott mit uns.—<name rend="sc">Wilhelm</name>."</p>
                <p>I sent the three romances to Clibbers and waited his
reply with anxiety. It came promptly and as follows:—"Are
you mad?—<name rend="sc">Clibbers.</name>"</p>
                <p>Instantly I sent him the first versions of these magnificent
fictions. He phoned me at once, "That's the
kind of novelty I want. Send me some more."</p>
                <p>You will see "Retrieved," "The Funk," and "Secret
Service" in the magazines shortly. Don't trouble if the
titles differ. After all, there are only three genuine War
story plots.</p>

many?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," she said. "There's the old Relief Committee, and
the Belgian Committee, and the Soldiers' Comforts' Committee,
and the Hospital Visitors' Committee, and the
Children's Meals' Committee, and the Entertainments'
Committee and the——"</p>
                <p>"Enough," I said. "I will take the rest for granted.
But isn't there a danger that with all these committees——?"</p>
                <p>"I know," she said; "you're going to say something
about overlapping."</p>
                <p>"Your insight," I said, "is wonderful. How did you
know?"</p>
                <p>"I've noticed," she said, "that when men form committees
they always declare that there sha'n't be any overlapping,
and then, according to their own account, they get to
work and all overlap like mad. Now we women don't
worry about overlapping. Most of us don't know what it
means—I don't myself—but we appoint presidents and
treasurers and secretaries, and then we go ahead and do
things. If we were only left to ourselves we should never
call a meeting of any committee after we'd once started it.
It's the men who insist on committees meeting."</p>
                <p>"Yes, and on keeping them from breaking their rules."</p>
                <p>"What's the use of having committees if you can't break
their silly old rules?"</p>

and return to Mrs. Rowley."</p>
                <p>"Well," she said, "we soon got on to the War."</p>
                <p>"You might easily do that," I said. "The subject has
its importance. What does Mrs. Rowley think of it?"</p>

hasn't the least doubt about anything. She knows the
uncle of a man whose cousin is in the War Office and often
sees Lord <name rend="sc">Kitchener</name> in the corridors, and he's quite
certain——"</p>
                <p>"Who? Lord <name rend="sc">Kitchener</name>?"</p>
                <p>"No, the uncle of the man whose cousin—he's quite
certain the War will be over in our favour before next June,
because there'll be a revolution in Potsdam and thousands
of Germans are being killed in bread-riots every day, and
lots of stuff of that sort."</p>
                <p>"I understand," I said.
"You began to react against
it."</p>
                <p>"Something of that kind.
She was so terribly serene
and so dreadfully over-confident
that I got contradictious
and had to argue with
her—simply couldn't restrain
myself—and then she said
she was sorry I was such a
pessimist, and I said I wasn't,
and here I am."</p>
                <p>"Yes," I said, "you are,
and in a state of Cimmerian
gloom,  naturally enough.
But you've come to the
right place—no, by Jove,
now that I think of it you've
come to the wrong place, the
very wrongest place in the world."</p>
                <p>"How's that?"</p>
                <p>"Because I met old Captain Burstall out walking, and
he was miserable about everything. According to him we
haven't got a dog's chance anywhere. The Government's
rotten, the Army's rotten, the Navy's worse and the
British Empire's going to be smashed up before Easter."</p>
                <p>"Captain Burstall's the man for my money. If I'd only
met him I should have been as cheerful as a lark."</p>
                <p>"And that," I said, "is exactly what I am, entirely
owing to a natural spirit of contradiction. I just pulled
myself together and countered him on every point."</p>
                <p>"I daresay you did it very well," she said; "but if
you're as cock-a-hoop as you make out I don't see how I'm
ever to get rid of my depression. I shall be starting to
contradict <hi rend="it">you</hi> next."</p>
                <p>"Which," I said, "will be an entirely novel experience
for both of us. But I'll tell you a better way; let's keep
silent for ten minutes and simmer back to our usual
condition of reasonable hopefulness."</p>
                <p>"I can't promise silence," she said, "but I'll back myself
against the world as a simmerer."</p>

                <head>ANOTHER AIR SCANDAL.</head>
                <p>If ever I write a Hymn of Hate, or,
at any rate, of resentment, it will not
be about the Germans, but about a
certain type of Englishman whom I
encounter far too often and shall never
understand. The Germans are now
beyond any hymning, however fervent;
they are, it is reassuring to think, a
class by themselves. But my man
should be hymned, not because it will
do him any good, but because it relieves
my feelings.</p>
                <p>It is really rather a curious case, for
he might be quite a nice fellow and, I
have little doubt, often is; but he boasts
and flaunts an inhuman insensibility
that excites one's worst passions.</p>
                <p>What would you say was the quality
or characteristic most to be desired in
every member of our social common-wealth?
Obviously there is only one
reply to this question: that he should
be decently susceptible to draughts. If
society is to go on, either we must all
be so pachydermatous as to be able
to disregard draughts, or we must
feel them and act accordingly. There
should not be here and there a strange
Ishmaelite creature whose delight it
is to be played upon by boreal blasts.
But there is. I meet him in the train,
and the other day I hymned him.</p>

                <head>AT THE FRONT.</head>
                <p>Of recent days we have almost
stopped pretending to be soldiers and
owned up to being civilian labourers
lodged in the War zone. This is felt
so acutely that several leading privates
have quite discarded that absolute
attribute of the infantryman, the rifle.
They return from working parties
completely unarmed, discover the fact
with a mild and but half-regretful
astonishment and report the circumstance
to section-commanders as if
they had lost one round of small arms
ammunition or the last cube from an
iron ration.</p>
                <p>The hobby of the civilian labourer
is obstacle-racing. To do this you
require a dark night, the assistance of
some Royal Engineers, an appointment
just behind the front line with
some supervisor of labour whom you
don't know and don't specially want
to, and a four-mile stretch across
country to the rendezvous.</p>
                <p>You start out at nightfall and do
good time over the first hundred yards.
The field consists of forty to eighty
labourers, and one of the idle rich (formerly
styled officers). At the hundred
yards' mark the Royal Engineers begin
to come in. Obstacle 1 is a model
trench, built for instructional purposes
and now being turned to
obstructional account. There's one
place where you can get on to the
parades without swimming, and if we
started by daylight we might strike
it. We do not start by daylight.</p>
                <p>Beyond the trench is a wire entanglement,
also a fine specimen of early
1915 R.E. work. We may note in
passing the trip wire eight yards
beyond. We're getting pretty good
with it now, but in our early days the
R.E. used to get a lot of marks for it.</p>
                <p>You go on towards a couple of moated
hedges, whimsically barbed in odd
spots, and emerge into a park or open
space leading into an unhealthy-looking
road. It seems all plain sailing to
the road—unless you know the R.E.,
in which case you will not be surprised
to find your neck nearly bisected
by a horizontal wire designed to encourage
telephonic communication.</p>
                <p>Eventually you all reach an area
known for some obscure reason—if for
any at all—as "The Brigade." Here
the R.E. have a new game waiting for
you. We call it "Hunt the Shovels."
You have been instructed to draw
shovels from the Brigade. The term
covers a space of some thousand square
metres intersected with hedges, bridges,
rivers, dugouts, horseponds (natural
and adventitious), any square metre of
which may contain your shovels.</p>
                <p>If you are not behind time so far
this is where you drop a quarter of an
hour. Of course you may just get fed
up and go home. But in that case you
aren't allowed to play again, and as a
matter of fact the game is rather <title>de
rigueur</title> out here. So you hide your
party behind a sign-post, which tells
you—if it were not too dark to read—<name rend="sc">Infantry
Must Not Halt Here</name>,
and then a lance-corporal with a good
nose for shovels looks through the more
likely hiding-places. The search is
rendered pleasant as well as interesting
by the fact that all the Brigade
has been trodden into a morass by
months of shovel-hunting.</p>
                <p>Beyond the Brigade the obstacles
really begin. But if you use a revolver
freely for wire-cutting and rope your
party together—this prevents anyone
sitting down by the wayside to take
his boots off "because they draws that
bad"—you will reach the rendezvous
assigned to you within an hour of the
time assigned to you. At this point you
will learn that no guide has been seen
or heard of there, and, subsequently,
that the guide was warned for another
square that certainly looks very similar
on the map. But again, if you
know guides, you will guess that he
went straight to the spot where the
job was to be done without bothering
about anything so intricate or superfluous
as a rendezvous. Anyhow you
will probably end by getting some sort
of casual labour somewhere, some time
or other, and no questions asked so
long as you don't inadvertently dig
through from a main drain into a
C.O.'s dugout.</p>
                <p>There is a new joke too, a Red Book,
out of which we are gradually becoming
millionaires. It is full of comfortable
claims and allowances for gentlemen
serving the <name rend="sc">King</name> overseas. The
only thing is it takes a bit of working
out. There are so many channels of
enrichment. Thus in June—I forget
the exact date—I spent a night in the
train. Although I had a bed and beer
in bottles all the way from England,
not to mention usual meals and part
use of doctor, I became entitled to one
franc ten centimes in lieu of something
which I have now forgotten. (Authority,
W.O. Letter 2719.)
Then a broken revolver is worth no
less than seventy-two shillings, but I
have to collect autographs to get that
Unclaimed groom's allowance—I don't
think my groom has claimed it—comes
to nearly four-and-sixpence; and I find
I have been quite needlessly getting
my hair cut at my own expense these
many months.</p>
                <p>And yet I am afraid that when
have made it all out and got a chartered
accountant to account for it—that
ought to mean a few pounds
Chartered Accountant allowance—my
application will be returned to me
because the envelope is not that shade
of mauve officially ordained for the
enclosure of Overseas Officers' Claims.</p>

"The piano with a thirty-foot keyboard,
forty-five octaves, and five hundred and
twenty-two keys, which Mr. Alfred Butt will
'present' in 'Follow the Crowd' at the
Empire Theatre, is now in course of construction.
Six pianists will play it, and Mr.
Irving Berlin, the composer of 'Watch Your
Step,' is composing some special melodies for
them."</p>

                <p>The new Bombastophone which the
Titanola Company are constructing for
Mr. Boomer, the famous War lecturer,
is approaching completion. This remarkable
instrument, which roughly
resembles a double-bassoon, stands
about 45 feet high, and has a compass
of 500 octaves, from the low B flat <title>in
profundissimo</title> to the high G on the
Doncaster St. Leger line. The use
that Mr. Boomer makes of the Bombastophone
is very original and effective.
Whenever he sees that the attention of
his audience is flagging he introduces
an interlude of "bombination," which
renders lethargy impossible and exercises
an indescribably stimulating effect
on the tympanum. The current of air
is supplied by a bellows operated by an
eight-cylinder Brome engine, but Mr.
Boomer works the keys himself, climbing
up and down them with a rapidity
which must be seen to be appreciated.</p>
                <p>Another instrument which is expected
to work a revolution in the realm
of sonority is the Clumbungo Drum,
on which Mr. Wackford Bumpus
will shortly give a recital at the Albert
Hall. The drum, which is made of
teak and rhinoceros hide, is three
hundred feet in circumference, but only
twenty feet high, and the drumsticks
are of proportionate length. As Dr.
Blamphin, the eminent aurist, remarks,
"The merit of the notes of this momentous
instrument is their profound sincerity.
They cannot be disregarded even
by the most absent-minded auditor."</p>

                <head>HINTS FOR AIR RAIDS.</head>
                <p>The War Office have issued a notice
reminding the public that they are
greatly inconvenienced by persons who
telephone for information during the
progress of an air raid. To avoid a
repetition of the trouble the attention
of the public is called to the following
information:—</p>
                <p>(1) Elderly ladies may deposit their
lap dogs in the bomb-proof shelter
erected for that purpose in the basement
of the War Office buildings at Whitehall,
a charge of one penny per dog
per raid being made.</p>
                <p>(2) Persons removed from the interior
of motor omnibuses by the
explosion of bombs dropped by airships
cannot claim from the Government a
refund of the fares paid by them.</p>
                <p>(3) Persons having reason to believe
that an air raid is in progress are
requested to put on their hats before
leaving the house, as it has been
ascertained that a hard hat is a substantial
protection against falling Zeppelins.</p>
                <p>(4) For the benefit of editors and
others who are dissatisfied with the
precautions taken to cope with the
Zeppelin peril, Messrs. Selfgrove &amp; Co.
announce that their new Strafing Room
will shortly be open to the public.</p>
                <p>(5) As the force of a bomb explosion
is largely in an upward direction, those
in the immediate vicinity of a dropping
bomb are advised to assume a recumbent
position, in which they will enjoy
the added advantage of being indistinguishable
from the pavement.</p>
                <p>(6) As theatre audiences are notoriously
subject to panic, actor-managers
are earnestly requested to prepare
beforehand some suitable jest with
which, in the event of a bomb entering
the theatre, the attention of the audience
may be distracted.</p>

                <head>UNDERGROUND GAME.</head>
                <p>It was four o'clock on a wet wintry
morning.</p>
                <p>Captain Blank executed an inadvertent
double-shuffle on a greasy
trench plank and wondered vaguely
why the rain should <hi rend="it">always</hi> come from
the north-east. Presently a figure
squelched up to him and halted.</p>
                <p>"'Tis Sergeant O'Hagan, Sorr," it
whispered hoarsely.</p>
                <p>"Well, Sergeant, what is it?"</p>
                <p>"'Tis the sintry at Fosse 19, Sorr.
He's reported quare noises in that
inimy sap beyant."</p>
                <p>"Been dreaming, I expect," muttered
the Captain, and then added briskly,
"I think I'll have a listen myself. Go
ahead, Sergeant."</p>
                <p>They made their way slowly along
the uneven trench, past silent figures
reclining in various attitudes of ease or
discomfort; past emplacements where
machine-guns and trench-mortars
were innocently sleeping (with one eye
always open) or being overhauled by
an expert night-nurse. Eventually,
by that instinct common to trench-dwellers
and professional poachers,
they found themselves at Fosse 19,
and with superlative caution crept up
to the sentry.</p>
                <p>"What's wrong?" whispered the
Captain tersely.</p>
                <p>"Well, Sir," replied Private Blobbs,
"I was standin' 'ere on listenin' duty,
when I 'ears somethink movin' very
contagious, so I pops up me 'ead to
'ave a peep. Didn't see nothink, but I
'ears a pecooliar noise like——There
y'are, Sir."</p>
                <p>He broke off abruptly, and, borne
upon the wind, came a series of guttural
murmurs.</p>
                <p>"Now wouldn't ut give one a quare
shtart, that?" remarked Sergeant
O'Hagan, <title>sotto voce</title>.</p>
                <p>"Um-m," said the Captain thoughtfully.
"I think Mr. Hamilton had
better have a look round."</p>
                <p>A few minutes later, having invaded
the privacy of "Whortleberry Villa,"
he was relentlessly prodding a bundle
of waterproofs.</p>
                <p>"Come on, young fella!" he exclaimed
when the bundle showed signs
of life; "bombin' party forward.
Brother Bosch is playin' the piccolo
just outside Fosse 19."</p>
                <p>The Subaltern scrambled out of his
wraps and, with incredible dispatch,
gathered together the Davids of his
section. "All guaranteed," so he
boasted, "to hit the cocoanut every
time."</p>
                <p>Accoutred with their infernal
machines, the little band of hope
passed along the trench as silently as
a party of Fenimore Cooper's North-American
Indians.</p>
                <p>"Yes, they're at home right
enough," muttered the Subaltern, after
a cramped interval of breathless attention,
"and fairly asking for it."</p>
                <p>He proceeded to make his dispositions
with the skill and assurance of
an old hand. He was nearly nineteen.</p>
                <p>"We're going to stalk 'em this
time," he whispered to the men; "you
keep on crawling till I say 'Go!'
Then drop it on them quick."</p>
                <p>He slid over the parapet like an eel
and disappeared into the night. In a
few moments the sentry was alone in
the trench. His state of mind was,
from sheer excitement, almost insupportable.</p>
                <p>After what seemed interminable
hours, at last he heard the clear word
of command, the clatter of things
falling and the immediate roar of the
explosions. In reply, rifle fire began
to break out along the German first
trenches, whilst, overhead, a star-shell
burst into blossom; then the stutter of
machine-guns joined in the chorus.
The sentry flattened himself like a
poultice against the side of the trench.
Fosse 19 had, among other disadvantages,
the reputation of being open to
enfilading by machine-gun fire.</p>
                <p>The disturbance died away as quickly
as it had arisen, but there were no
indications that the bombing party
was returning. Private Blobbs danced
with futile impatience and bent his
head to the approved angle of the
expert listener. Suddenly a heavy
body took him in the nape of the
neck.</p>
                <p>"Ow!" he exclaimed, floundering in
mud and water with an unseen and
inconceivable presence. He clutched
the nightmare of an ear and kicked
violently.</p>
                <p>"Look aht, Percy," enjoined a
hollow but reassuring voice, "'ere
comes another!"</p>
                <p>Private Blobbs removed himself with
remarkable agility.....</p>
                <p>"Good!" exclaimed the Subaltern
when he finally slid into the trench.
"This expedition hasn't quite come up
to expectations, but it's the nicest
family of pigs I've seen for some
time."</p>
                <p>He flashed an electric torch on to
the disordered carcasses.</p>
                <p>"Corporal Leary," he added incisively,
"will you kindly see that the
officers' mess is served with fresh
pork?"</p>
                <p>He snapped out the torch and, complete
master of the situation, started
on the return journey to "Whortleberry
Villa."</p>

                    <title>Tuesday, February 15th.</title>—To the
regret of all loyal citizens, the curtain
rang up at Westminster to-day without
the now customary Royal Overture.
In the absence of <name rend="sc">His Majesty</name>, the
<name rend="sc">Lord Chancellor</name> delivered the brief
Speech from the Throne, expressing
the unalterable determination of the
British people and their Allies to defeat
the Power (name not given but possibly
conjecturable) "which mistakes force
for right and expediency for honour."
To emphasise the unity of the nation
the Address was moved by the Unionist
Earl of <name rend="sc">Clarendon</name> and seconded by
the Liberal Lord <name rend="sc">Muir-Mackenzie</name>. It
was agreed to in good time for dinner.</p>
                <p>The Commons are not so economical
of time. Mr. <name rend="sc">Ian Macpherson</name>, who
moved the Address, made quite a long
speech. Like <title>Hamlet</title>, it was chiefly
composed of quotations, but they were
all quite apt, and as they ranged from
<name rend="sc">Thucydides</name> to <name rend="sc">Burke</name>, with <name rend="sc">Bolingbroke</name>'s
<title>Patriot King</title> thrown in, they
pleased the House, which likes these
tributes to its erudition. The seconder,
in khaki, was Col. F. S. <name rend="sc">Jackson</name>, a new
Member, who, like the still-lamented
<name rend="sc">Alfred Lyttelton</name>, had made a reputation
at Lord's ere ever he essayed
the Commons. "Jacker" found the new
wicket not quite to his liking at first,
but afterwards scored freely. In congratulating
the outgoing batsman the
<name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name> discovered unexpected
knowledge of cricket. "The Hon. Member,"
he said, "was making his maiden
speech; but I doubt if he has ever
encountered a maiden over—except,
perhaps, when he was bowling."</p>
                <p>In the regretted absence of the Leader
of the Opposition, Mr. <name rend="sc">Stuart-Wortley</name>
as Acting-<name rend="sc">Chaplin</name> referred to the disintegration
of parties under the stress
of war. Now they had only groups,
some designed to help the Government,
some to "ginger" them. Mr. <name rend="sc">Asquith</name>
dwelt upon the growing unity of control
among the Allies, which would
counteract the advantage in this respect
hitherto enjoyed by our foes; and
noted the amazing growth of the once
"contemptible little" British Army.
He further reminded us that we had
already incurred liabilities which it
would take us a generation to wipe out;
and it was the first duty of every patriotic
citizen to practise rigid economy.</p>
                <p>All very well, said, in effect, Mr.
<name rend="sc">Wardle</name>, the new leader of the
Labour Party; but, if the working
classes are to save, the other classes
must set them the example. All very
well, said Sir <name rend="sc">Mark Sykes</name>, but if we
are going to win the war we must co-ordinate
at home as well as abroad, and
abandon the idea of "muddling through."
With experience of G.H.Q. and four
public departments, he asserted that
the men were all right, but the system
all wrong; and that the proper thing
was to adopt <name rend="sc">Sultan Omar's</name> plan, and
give the supreme control of the War to
a Cabinet of not more than four members,
who with no administrative details
to distract them might be able to "teach
the doubtful battle where to rage."</p>
                <p>The <name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name> listened with
interest but without enthusiasm to this
suggestion. Probably he remembered
that an essential part of <name rend="sc">Omar</name>'s scheme
was that if the Four failed to agree
they were to be promptly hanged, and
had himself no ambition to take part
in a String Quartett.</p>

                    <title>Wednesday, February 16th.</title>—The
Trustees of the British Museum are
for the most part grave and reverend
seniors. But they harbour at least one
humourist among them, in Captain
<name rend="sc">Harry Graham</name>. I suspect him of
having conceived the notion of choosing
this moment, of all others, to frame a
petition to the House of Commons
praying for more money to enable
<pb xml:id="page140" n="pg 140"/>
them to fulfil their trust, and of getting
Mr. <name rend="sc">Lulu Harcourt</name>, himself a member
of the Government which is closing
their galleries, to present it.</p>
                <p>Sir <name rend="sc">Henry Dalziel</name> is the leader of
one of the "ginger groups" above
referred to. His first exploit in this
capacity was to resist the proposal of
the Government to take all the time of
the House. In his demand that private
Members should still be allowed the
privilege of introducing Bills and having
them printed at the public expense,
he had the support of Mr. <name rend="sc">Hogge</name>,
Mr. <name rend="sc">King</name>, Mr. <name rend="sc">Pringle</name>, Mr. <name rend="sc">Booth</name>,
Sir <name rend="sc">William Byles</name>, and other statesmen
of similar eminence; but the <name rend="sc">Prime
Minister</name> was obdurate. He accused
the malcontents of lacking a sense of
perspective—and expressed the poorest
opinion of their efforts at legislation.</p>
                <p>Some of the private Members got
their own back when the first amendment
to the Address was moved by
Mr. <name rend="sc">Joynson-Hicks</name>. The Member for
Brentford, who knows the alphabet of
aviation from Aeroplane to Zeppelin,
complained that the air-service, like his
own constituency in legendary times,
was under Dual Control, and urged
that it should be placed under a single
competent chief.</p>
                <p>Neither the <name rend="sc">Under-Secretary for
War</name> nor the <name rend="sc">First Lord of the Admiralty</name>
was at all happy in reply. They
resembled a couple of flying pilots who,
having gone up to attack a hostile airship
in the dark, search in vain for an
adequate landing-place. Heckled as to
the exact status of Sir <name rend="sc">Percy Scott</name>,
for example, Mr. <name rend="sc">Tennant</name> could only
say that he "is still in the position he
<hi rend="it">was</hi> in." When Mr. <name rend="sc">Ellis Griffith</name>
ventured the remark that a personal
knowledge of flying would be a useful
qualification for officers advising the
Government on this subject, Mr. <name rend="sc">Balfour</name>
was as painfully surprised as if
he himself had been called upon to
navigate a.t.b.d. in heavy weather.</p>
                <p>In the absence of any definite sign of
repentance the critics of the Government
threatened a division, which
would have been awkward and might
have been disastrous. In similar circumstances
Mr. <name rend="sc">Gladstone</name> used to
"send for the sledge-hammer"—meaning
Mr. <name rend="sc">Asquith</name>. The present <name rend="sc">Prime
Minister</name>, when hard pressed, sends
for <name rend="sc">Bonar</name>. Thus summoned to ride
the whirlwind the <name rend="sc">Colonial Secretary</name>
executed a graceful volplane. In a few
frank sentences he admitted that the
Government were very far from being
satisfied with the Air Service, though it
had achieved great things. Further, they
were willing to give another day for its
discussion when they had got through
their financial business. With this confession
and promise the critics were
for the time being appeased.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Thursday, February 17th.</title>—This
being the first day for which Questions
could be put down, Members took full
advantage of the opportunity, and propounded
ninety-nine of them. Ministers
displayed less enthusiasm, and some of
them were so late in arriving that the
<name rend="sc">Speaker</name> had to dodge about all over
the paper before the list was disposed
of. Mr. <name rend="sc">Ginnell</name> was, as usual, well
to the fore with silly rumours. There
is perhaps a subtle connection between
cattle-driving and hunting for mare's nests.</p>
                <p>The pleasantest feature of Question
time was the tribute paid (with hint of
more substantial rewards to come after
the War) to the gallantry and self-sacrifice
of the officers and men of our
mercantile marine. This furnished an
appropriate prelude to the subject of
the ensuing debate. Mr. <name rend="sc">Peto</name> and
others sought to press upon the
Government the more economical use
of our merchant shipping. Here they
were forcing an open door. Steps have
already been taken to restrict the imports
of luxuries. Ministers are unanimous,
I believe, in regarding "ginger,"
for instance, as an article whose importation
might profitably be curtailed.</p>

                <p>It happened in Scotland—it couldn't
have happened anywhere else.</p>
                <p>I had been visiting the MacNeils.
They sympathised over my wound; they
rallied round with tea and toast; they
provided Scotch whisky. My one objection
to the family was their supreme
confidence in these new-fledged lads
of the Home Defence, whom I—as a
Subaltern of the old school who had
done my time at Sandhurst before the
War—scorned with a dogged contempt
which no degree of argument could kill.</p>
                <p>It was when I reached the street
that I realised that fervid fire in the
soul of Scotch hospitality—a fire which
brands it as unique in our island story.
In my coat pocket reposed a bottle of
Heather Dew.</p>
                <p>The convalescent home where I was
being wooed back to brisk health was
situated along the sea-front. Chuckling
at the MacNeils' efforts to modify my
views of our Home Defenders and their
inefficiency, and brooding on the folks'
kind hearts, I paused to light a
cigarette. The wind blew out the
fluttering flame. It also set me sneezing,
for I had a bad cold in the head.
I struck another match.</p>
                <p>"Hey!" said a voice suddenly behind
me. I swerved, choking back a sneeze.
"Hey, hey, hey!" some broad Doric
tongue continued.</p>
                <p>A heavy hand came plump on my
shoulder; a large Highland face was
pushed into mine; a kilt flapped round
long bare shanks. I sneezed again.</p>
                <p>"Got ye this time, lad!" announced
the son of the North, who now appeared
to be a brawny lance-corporal. "Signallin'
ye are. Oot to sea. Ah saw ye
blinkin' wi' a licht."</p>
                <p>I sneezed again. "I was'd!" I
declared as well as the cold in my
head would allow. "It was a batch.
I've dever sigdalled id by life. You're
wrog—quite wrog!"</p>
                <p>He gripped me firmly by the arm.</p>
                <p>"Dinna tell me!" he announced in
conclusive tones. "Ah ken better!
Ye're the second spy Ah've cotched.
Come along, ma freend Fritz! Ye'll
hae the job o' explainin' to the Colonel
whaur ye got that second-lootenant's
uniform."</p>
                <p>Hunching his rifle over his shoulder,
he marched me back the way I had
come.</p>
                <p>"Where are you takig be to?" I
enquired thickly. "Take be to your
Cobbadig Officer at wudce. I wad to
egsplaid!"</p>
                <p>"Ah'll hae nane o' your clavers,"
he said shortly. "Ye're for the gaird-room.
Dinna tell ma ye're no a German
wi' a tongue like yon!"</p>
                <p>"I've god a gold id by head!" I
shouted at him. "I'b dot a Gerbud!
I'b Lieutedad Dobsod——"</p>
                <p>"Haud yer tongue. Ye're a Chooton.
An' ye're cotched. That's flat."</p>
                <p>I was bundled into a draughty cattle-shed.
The door was slammed. I
sneezed. It was a bright prospect. I
changed my views on the inefficiency
of our Home Defenders. They now
appealed to me as violently efficient.
A night in a tumble-down cow-house!
Desolation! Then I brightened up:
the MacNeils' whisky. The cork
popped in the silence of the night.</p>
                <p>The door opened. A sentry's head
was poked round. Disregarding him,
I raised the bottle to my chattering
teeth. Then the lance-corporal
appeared. With a sudden thought I
offered him the bottle. A strange look
crept across his face. Gingerly he took
the bottle. Then there was a comfortable
sound. He drew a hand across
his mouth.</p>
                <p>"That's grrand," he said. "Beg
pardon, Sir. It's been ma mistake.
Jock, the prisoner is a Scottish officer.
Let him gang.... Thank ye, Sir;
thank ye for the whisky."</p>

                <div xml:id="d1e1751" type="div3">
                    <head>The Miracle.</head>
                    <p>Once upon a time there was one
Herbert. The doctor being unwilling to
pass him so that there was no chance
that he, in the words of the great joke,
would "march too," he had taken a
situation as a waiter.</p>
                    <p>Englishmen (it is an axiom) do not
make good waiters; nor was he an
exception. But he was conscientious
and painstaking, although clumsy and
of short memory. Still, this
was war-time, and Hans had
gone to Germany and might
now be dead, and Fritz very
properly was interned, and Josef
had sought Vienna once more,
and Pasquale and Giuseppe had
rejoined the Italian flag, and the
only foreigners left were a few
nondescripts, very volubly, indeed
almost passionately, of
Swiss nationality. In fact, if
this War has done nothing else
it has at least established the
fact that the male population of
Switzerland is far greater than
any one had supposed. Gallant
little Switzerland!</p>
                    <p>So you see this was Herbert's
chance, and the manager was
glad to get him; and Herbert,
who, owing to the slump in
games, had lost his job at an
athletic sports factory and had
certain financial liabilities which
he had long since abandoned
any hope of meeting, was glad
to come. Only, by infinite self-denial
and sacrifice did he get
together the necessary capital
for his clothes and the deposit
demanded from waiters against
breakages, theft and so forth.</p>
                    <p>On his first day as one in
charge of three or four tables
Herbert made some very serious
mistakes. He was complained
of for slowness, he turned over
a sauce-boat, he broke a glass, and
he forgot to charge for the cigar which
the portly gentleman in the corner had
taken after his lunch. And this cigar
was a half-crown Corona, for the portly
gentleman either had not yet grasped
the full meaning of War economy or
was enjoying one of those periodical
orgies to which even rigid economist
think themselves to be entitled.</p>
                    <p>Already Herbert had, like <title>Alnaschar</title>
in the Eastern tale, spent imagination
far more than he could make all the
week, and this blow, with the manager's
abuse to serve as salt in the wound,
sent him home in misery. Nor was
it as if the portly gentleman was a
regular customer who could be reminded
of the error (little as such
reminding is to the taste of regular
customers); on the contrary, he had
never been known to visit the restaurant
before. You see, then, how unhappily
Herbert viewed life as he
lay awake in his attic that night,
and very heavy were his feet on his
way to work the next day, with an
overcoat buttoned up to his neck to
hide his evening dress.</p>
                    <p>It was a cold rainy morning; the
wind raged; and the very indifferent
soles of Herbert's boots absorbed moisture
like blotting-paper. Everything
was against him. There was not a
gleam of hope in the future, not a ray
of light. His companions were surly,
the manager was venomous, the bitter
rain fell on. He was in debt and would
get the sack.</p>
                    <p>It was then that the miracle happened.
Suddenly Herbert, who was
gazing forlornly through the window
at this disconsolate world, waiting,
napkin on his arm, to begin to wait,
heard a voice saying, "I'm afraid you
forgot to charge me for my cigar yesterday."
It was the portly gentleman.
Life was not utterly hopeless any
more.</p>

                <p>(<title>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</title>)</p>
                <p>In fiction it is certainly true that nothing succeeds like
success. There is a sure and very understandable charm in
a story of climbing fortunes. Therefore it may be that part
of my pleasure in <title>Tasker Jevons</title> (<name rend="sc">Hutchinson</name>) was due to
sympathy with the upward progress of its hero. But much
more was certainly due to the art with which Miss <name rend="sc">May
Sinclair</name> has written about it. <title>Tasker Jevons</title> is a book,
and a character, that will linger pleasantly in my memory.
He was a little man with a great personality, or rather I
will say a great purpose, and that was to approve himself
in the eyes of the wife whom he worshipped, and her perplexed,
slightly contemptuous family. The trouble was that
<title>Tasker</title> was in the beginning a hack journalist, socially and
personally impossible; and that <title>Viola Thesiger</title>, whom he
married, belonged by birth to the rigidest circle of Cathedral
society (Miss <name rend="sc">Sinclair</name>, scorning subterfuge, calls it quite
openly Canterbury). So you see the difficulties that beset
the <title>Jevons</title> pair. Their story is told here, very effectively,
through the mouth of a third person, a fellow-journalist and
admirer of <title>Jevons</title>—but quite respectable—the rejected
suitor of <title>Viola</title>, and eventually the husband of her sister.
Through his clever and observant eyes we watch the
progress of <title>Jevons</title>, see him prospering materially, becoming
famous and rich and vulgarized. It is an unusually close
and rather subtle study of the development of such a
man. Eventually there happens that for which the date,
Midsummer 1914, will have prepared you, even if you
had forgotten that Miss <name rend="sc">Sinclair</name> had herself served in
Belgium with a field ambulance. So the end of the book
gives us some vivid War pictures. Taking it all round, I
am inclined to consider <title>Tasker Jevons</title> the best of the 1916
novels that has yet come my way.</p>

                <p>When, in the first chapter of <title>Moll Davis</title> (<name rend="sc">Allen and
Unwin</name>), you find the heroine having a very pretty dispute
with the landlord of the Mischief Inn, and a gallant blade
of a fellow coming to her rescue, you will guess what fare
is to follow. And, provided that your taste is for diet of
the lightest, you will not be disappointed, for no one is
more capable than Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard Capes</name> of making it palatable.
Here we are then back in the year 1661, and in a
maze of intrigue. Wit, if we are to believe the novelist, was
as plentiful in those days as morals were scarce, and
Mr. <name rend="sc">Capes</name> is not the man to spoil tradition for lack of
colour. He calls his book a comedy, but he should have
called it a comedy with an interlude; and the part I like
best is the interlude. Possibly because he was weary of
plots and counterplots he suddenly breaks loose, and with a
warning to those who have "an unconquerable repugnance
to sentiment" tells a moving tale that has nothing to do
with the main narrative. I can thank him unreservedly
for this, and for the crop of words which he has added
to my vocabulary. "Bingawast," "gingumbobs," and
"fubbs" have the right ring, and after a little training I
hope to use them with telling effect on my platoon.</p>

                    <title>Edith Ottley</title> cherished a passion for <title>Aylmer Ross</title>; to
such an extent indeed that she came within an ace of
eloping with him. However, the ace wasn't played; and
in due course <title>Aylmer</title> went to the War and became a
captain. Unfortunately he also became much more interesting
by reason of a wound; and, when this brought him
back to England, the passion also returned, stronger than
ever. This, of course, is why their story is called <title>Love at
Second Sight</title> (<name rend="sc">Grant Richards</name>). I have now a small
surprise for you, namely that <title>Edith</title> was already married,
and owned a charming house, a valetudinarian husband
and two pleasant children. So I quite expected that
<title>Aylmer</title>, in the fulness of time, would either (1) be removed
by the enemy, or (2) marry a delightful little Red-Cross
nurse who adored him. But the author, Mrs. <name rend="sc">Leverson</name>,
had other views. Instead therefore of ending her heroine
in the expected mood of conventional reconciliation she
sends the objectionable husband off with somebody else,
and leaves us to a prospect of wedding-bells with the
divorce court as a preliminary.
Which is at least original.
But throughout I had the feeling
that a great deal of bright
and clever writing was being
wasted on a poor theme. The
characters are brilliantly suggested,
but—with perhaps
one exception, forgetful <title>Lady
Conroy</title>, who is an entire delight—they
seem altogether
unworthy of it. In fact I
came away from the book
with the impression of having
attended a gathering of somewhat
shoddily smart people,
and sat next to a clever woman
who had been witty about
them. The worst of the
matter is that they are all so
real. This is a tribute to the
author, but a most unpleasant
reflection for everyone else.</p>

                <p>My attention was first
attracted to <title>The New Dawn</title>
(<name rend="sc">Long</name>) by the fact that the plot starts at Euston Station.
That interesting, not to say romantic, line, the L. &amp; N. W. R.,
is usually shunned by our novelists. But although
"<name rend="sc">George Wovil</name>" takes his characters to the furthest North,
even beyond Glasgow, their sympathies, like, I think, those
of their creator, remain behind in fair and false and fickle
Wimbledon. This at least was where <title>Halvey Brown</title>
wished himself as the train glided over the best laid track
in Europe towards dour Bartocher. And <title>Brown</title>, though
he knew the natural drabness of his destination already,
had at that time no information as to all the unpleasing
events that were to happen there; that, for example, the
minister's new wife would turn out to be a lady with a past
that he himself had shared, or that the fair-haired young
man in the same compartment was the assistant minister,
who would fall in love with the said wife and eventually
slay her, the minister, and himself. I find I have been led
into betraying for you the outline of the story. Perhaps, however,
this does not greatly matter. The value of the book
lies in its very natural and human characters. All four
of them—there are only four who really matter—are admirably
drawn, so that the tragedy of their lives holds and
convinces you. My complaints against the author are, first,
the excess of emphasis that he gives to the physical unpleasantness
of his background; secondly, the loose construction
that allows the tale to be continually turning back to look
behind it. He would keep a lover in the act of embracing
the lady of his heart while he explains what the parents of
each died of, and all that has happened since. Still, <title>The
New Dawn</title> remains an unconventional and strongly written
story, which will certainly interest though perhaps hardly
enliven you.</p>

                <p>There is something very soothing in the peeps into dusty
family papers and the faint echoes of departed gossip which
Mrs. <name rend="sc">Stirling</name> provides in <title>A Painter of Dreams</title> (<name rend="sc">Lane</name>).
These pleasantly amateurish historical studies go back a
century and a half. A commonplace book from which are
quoted many diverting and incredible things; a chapter in
which those queer Radicals, <name rend="sc">Horne Tooke, Cobbett</name>, Sir
<name rend="sc">Francis Burdett</name> and bluff Squire <name rend="sc">Bosville</name>, are chiefly
concerned; a sketch of the fourth Earl of <name rend="sc">Albemarle</name>,
keen farmer and friend of <name rend="sc">Coke</name> of Norfolk, Master of the
Horse to <name rend="sc">William IV</name>. and
<name rend="sc">Queen Victoria</name> (it is to
<name rend="sc">Albemarle</name> in this capacity
that the <name rend="sc">Iron Duke</name> said:
"The Queen can make you go
inside the coach, or outside
the coach, or run behind it
like a d——d tinker's dog"),
winner of the Ascot Gold Cup
three years running and stiff-backed
autocrat; an account
of the beautiful Misses <name rend="sc">Caton</name>
of Baltimore and their matrimonial
adventures—the American
invasion of brides bringing
money and beauty in exchange
for titles thus dating back to
1816; some details of the lives
of two artists, <name rend="sc">John Herring</name>,
animal painter, and <name rend="sc">Roddam
Spencer Stanhope</name>, one of the
lesser pre-Raphaelites and the
painter of dreams referred to
in the title—these all make up
an agreeable pot-pourri with
an old-world fragrance which
ought to be able to charm you out of the preposterous
nightmare of the present. But it makes one feel old to
see that the conscientious author thinks that <name rend="sc">Dicky Doyle</name>
now needs a footnote to let the present generation know
who he was.</p>
