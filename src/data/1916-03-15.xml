                <p>The Zeppelin which was "winged"
while flying over Kent last week has
not yet been found, and is believed to
be still in hiding in the densely wooded
country between Maidstone and Ashford.
Confirmation of this report is
supplied by a local farmer, who states
that on three successive nights the
cat's supper has been stolen from his
scullery steps. This strange circumstance,
considered in the light of the
Germans' inordinate passion for cats'
meat, has gone far to satisfy the authorities
that the capture of the crippled
monster is only a question of time.</p>

that you are the sole support of a stepmother

felt it your duty to attest without
appealing for exemption, we applaud
your patriotism. But, when you go on
to complain that your neighbour, aged

still in her teens and childless, should
be free to decline service if he chooses
(as he does), we cannot but disapprove
of your irreverent and almost immoral

                <head>BUILDING WITHOUT TEARS.</head>
                <p>The enthralling correspondence in
the columns of our contemporary, <title>The
Spectator</title>, on the subject of cheap cottages
and how to build them, has
evoked a vast amount of correspondence
addressed directly to us. We select a
few specimens which are recommended
by their practical and businesslike
character:—</p>
                <p>
                    <name rend="sc">The Merits of "Posh."</name>

                <p>
                    <name rend="sc">Dear Sir</name>,—The question of Land
Settlement after the War resolves itself
in the last resort into the employment
of cheaper methods of cottage building.
Will you allow me to put in a word for
the revival, in the neighbourhood of the
sea, of the old Suffolk plan of building
with what is locally known as "posh,"
after the name of the original inventor,
who was an ancestor of <name rend="sc">Fitzgerald's</name>
friend. "Posh" is a mixture of old
boots—of which a practically unlimited
supply can be found on the beaches of
seaside resorts—and seaweed, boiled
into a jelly, allowed to solidify, and then
frozen hard in cold storage. "Posh"
is not only (1) impenetrable but also
(2) hygienic, the iodine in the seaweed
lending it a peculiarly antiseptic quality,
and (3) picturesque, the colour of the
compound being a dark purple, which
is exceedingly pleasing to the eye.
Lastly, the cost of production is slight,
as the raw material can be obtained for
nothing, and the compound can be
sawn into blocks or bricks to suit the
taste of the tenant. I am convinced
that cottages of "posh" could be built
for less than a hundred pounds a-piece;
and at that figure cheap housing becomes
a practical proposition.</p>
                <p>I am, Sir, yours faithfully,</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    <name rend="sc">Dear Sir</name>,—The choice of material
matters little so long as it is properly
treated. Any sort of earth will do, or,
failing earth, a mixture of ashes with
a little mustard and marmalade, the
waste of which in most households is
prodigious. But it must be properly
pounded and allowed to set in a frame.
For the former process there is no better
implement than the old Gloucestershire
stoot, or stooting-mallot, or in the alternative
a disused niblick. The earth,
or the "marmash" mixture, as I have
christened it, should be poured into a
bantle-frame—which can be made by
any village carpenter—and vigorously
pounded for about three hours. Then
another bantle-frame is placed on the
first, and the process is repeated. No
foundation is required for walls erected
by the plan of stooting, but a damp-course
of mulpin is advisable, and
it is always best to pingle the door-jambs,
and binge up the rafters with
a crumping-block.</p>
                <p>I am, Sir, yours obediently,</p>

                <p>
                    <name rend="sc">Dear Sir</name>,—When I was an under-graduate
at Balliol more years ago
than I care to remember, I not only
took part in the road-making experiment
carried out under <name rend="sc">Ruskin</name>'s supervision,
but assisted in the erection of a
model cottage, the walls of which were
made of "bap," a compound which is
still used in parts of Worcestershire.
The receipt is very simple. You mix
clinkers, wampum and spelf in equal
quantities and condense the compound
by hydraulic pressure. I have
a well-trained hydraulic ram who is
capable of condensing enough "bap"
in twenty-four hours to provide the
materials for building six four-roomed
cottages. I am sorry to say that the
"bap" cottage at Hinksey was washed
away by a flood a few years ago, and
the spot where it stood is no longer
identifiable. But the facts are as I
have stated them.</p>

                <p>I  wonder if the chap who first
thought out this shell business realized
the extraordinary inconvenience it
would cause to gentlemen at rest
during what the Photographic Press
alludes to as "a lull in the fighting."</p>
                <p>Once upon a time billets were billets.
You came into such, and thereafter for
a spell of days forgot about the War
unless you got an odd shell into the
kitchen. But now—well, about noon
on the first day's rest, seventy
odd batteries of our 12, 16, and
24 inch guns set about their
daily task of touching up a
selected target, say a sap-head
or something new from Unter
den Linden in spring barbed-wirings
which has been puzzling
a patrol. This is all
right in its way; but the Hun
still owns one or two guns
opposite us. And by 12.5 all
is unquiet on the Western
Front. This is all right in its
way; but about 3 <name rend="sc">P.M.</name> the Hun
is roused to the depths of his
savage nature, and one wakes
up to find Hildebrand and Hoffelbuster,
the two guns told
off to attend to our liberty
area, scattering missiles far
and wide, but mostly wide,
and a covey of aeroplanes
bombing the local cabbageries.
This again is all right in its
way, but in the meantime the
mutual noise further up the
line has become so loud that
Someone very far back and
high up catches the echo of it,
and a bare hour later we receive
the order to stand-to at
once, ready to move off twenty
minutes ago.</p>
                <p>Within three minutes of our
first stand-to I was up with
the company, hastily but adequately
mobilized with my
servant's rifle, five smoke helmets,
(I took all I could see; this is
<hi rend="it">camaraderie</hi>), a biscuit, the Indispensable
Military Pocket Book (8 in.
by 10 in.), a revolver (disqualified for
military uses owing to absence of
ammunition), Russian Picture Tales,
and a tooth-brush. I find a general
opinion prevalent in the company that
"if Fritz knew <hi rend="it">we</hi> was standing-to 'e'd
pack in." Word must have come
through to Fritz somehow, for he
shortly packs in—say about 1 <name rend="sc">A.M.</name>—and
we follow suit after the news has
spent a couple or hours or so flashing
round the wires in search of us. And
we go to sleep until to-morrow midday,
when the day's play begins again.</p>
                <p>When we had been thus "rested"
for some days we went and took over
a nice new line, with lots of funny bits
in it. The front line had three bits.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Left sector</title>—Mine (exploded; possibly
held by Bosch on far side).</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Central sector</title>—Mine? (unexploded;
not held by Bosch anywhere).</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Right sector</title>—Mine (exploded; possibly
held by Bosch on far side).</p>
                <p>Our position seemed a little problematical.
The left and right we satisfied
ourselves about at once, but the centre
was in a class by itself. We demanded
an investigator, somebody with wide
mine-sweeping experience preferred.</p>
                <p>About 2 <name rend="sc">A.M.</name> on our first day in,
a figure loomed up through a snow-storm
from the back of the central
trench and asked forlornly if there
might be any mines hereabouts. We
admitted there might be, or again there
might not. He questioned us precisely
where it was suspected, and we
told him "underneath." He scratched
his head and announced that he was
sent to look for it. His qualifications
consisted apparently in his having
coal-mined. But he seemed confident
of detecting the quicker combustion
sort, until he asked for necessary impedimenta.
It seems that no good
collier can detect an H.E. or any sort
of mine without a pail of water, and
a hole about 2,000 feet deep, and a
pulley, and a rope ladder and a bratting-slat.</p>
                <p>It's true we had some good holes
in parts of the trench, where you
probably go down 2,000 feet if you
step off the footboards, and the rest of
the stuff we might have contrived to
improvise. But for the moment we
had somehow run clean out of bratting-slats.</p>
                <p>So we had to return the
poor fellow with a request
that all experts should be
completed with bratting-slats
before being sent to the front
line. This request only produced
the senseless interrogation,
"What <hi rend="it">is</hi> a bratting-slat?"
to which we have not
yet bothered to reply. In the
meantime if we are really sitting
on a mine it seems quite
a tame one. It hasn't as much
as barked yet.</p>
                <p>Just in our bit we aren't
very well off for dug-outs; it
isn't really what you'd call a
representative sector from any
point of view. But during a
blizzard the other night a
messenger who had mislaid
himself took us for a serious
trench. He made his way
along, looking to right and left
for some seat of authority
until he came to a hole in the
parados, two feet by one,
where some fortunate fellow
had ejected an ammunition
box and was attempting to boil
water on a night-light. The
messenger bent low and asked
huskily—</p>
                <p>"Is this 'ere comp'ny edquarters?"</p>
                <p>The water-boiler looked up.
"No," he replied, "it ain't.

                <head>TO THE KING OF SPAIN.</head>
                <p>
                    <name rend="sc">Your Majesty</name>, There is a little village
in England nestling among wooded
hills. It has sent forth its bravest and
best from cottage and farm and manor-house
to fight for truth and liberty and
justice. The news of grievous wounds
and still more grievous deaths, of men
missing and captured, comes often to
that quiet hamlet, and the roll of
honour in the little grey stone church
grows longer and longer. In the big
house on the hill, at sunrise and at
sunset, the young Lady of the Manor
stands at the bedside of her little son,
and hears him lisp his simple prayers
to God, and they always end like
this:—</p>
                <quote>
                    <p>
"And God bless Father and Mother
and Nurse, and send Father back soon
from his howwid prison in Germany.
And God bless 'specially the dear King
of <name rend="sc">Spain</name>, who found out about Father.
Amen."

                <p>The kings of the earth have many
priceless possessions; they are able to
confer upon each other various glittering
orders of merit and distinction;
but we doubt if any one of them has a
dearer possession or a more genuine
order of merit than this simple prayer
of faith and gratitude offered at sunrise
and at sunset on behalf of Your Majesty
by the bedside of a little English child.</p>

                <head>A QUESTION OF THE NUDE.</head>
                <p>They scrambled into the carriage in
a tremendous hurry, all talking at
once at the tops of their voices, all very
excited and very dirty. They had mud
on their boots which had evidently
come from France, and their overcoats
had that rumpled appearance which
distinguishes overcoats from the Front
from those merely in training.</p>
                <p>There seemed to be about ten of
them as they got into the train, but
when they had deposited various objects
on the rack, such as rifles, haversacks,
and kit-bags like partially deflated airships,
the number resolved itself into
three.</p>
                <p>The compartment already contained—besides
myself—a naval warrant
officer, reading <title>Freckles</title> with a
sentimental expression, and a large
leading seaman with hands like small
hams and a peaceful smile like a jade
Buddha. It said "H.M.S. Hedgehog"
round his cap, but when I ventured to
remark that I once in peace-time saw
and visited that vessel he observed with
indifference that "cap-ribbons was
nothin' to go by these days; point o'
fact, he never see that there ship in
his puff." Otherwise they maintained
that deep and significant silence which
we have learned to associate with our
Navy.</p>
                <p>The Tommies, however, were in very
talkative vein. "Now," I thought, "I
shall doubtless hear some real soldiers'
stories of the War, even as the newspaper
men hear them and reproduce
them in the daily prints: the crash of
the artillery, the wild excitement of
battle—in short, the Real Thing...."</p>
                <p>A momentous question had evidently
been under discussion when they entered
the train, and as soon as they were
settled in their seats they resumed it.</p>
                <p>"Wot I want to know is," said the
largest of the three, a big man with a
very square face and blue eyes,—"wot
I want to know is—is that there feller
to go walkin' about naked?" The
last word was pronounced as a monosyllable.</p>
                <p>He set his fists squarely on his
knees and glared around him with a
challenging expression.</p>
                <p>"No, it's agin the law," said a small
man with a very hoarse voice.</p>
                <p>"Course it is," rejoined the other.
"Well, wot's the feller to do? That's
wot I ast you. If 'e walks about
naked, well, 'e gets took up for bein'
naked; if 'e doesn't, why, 'e gets 'ad
for not returnin' 'is uniform."</p>
                <p>He looked round again and decided
to take the rest of us into consultation.</p>
                <p>"This 'ere's 'ow it stands—see?
'Ere's a feller got the mitten along o'
not bein' able to march, through gettin'
shot in the leg. 'E goes 'ome pendin'
'is <hi rend="it">dis</hi>charge, an' o' course e' walks
about in 'is uniform. Then 'e gets 'is
<hi rend="it">dis</hi>charge, an' they tells 'im to return
'is kar-kee <title>an'</title> small kit——"</p>
                <p>"An' small kit?" burst out the third
member of the party indignantly—a
sprightly youth with a very short tunic
and a pert expression. "Do they want
you to return your small kit when you
get the mitten? Watch me returnin'
mine, that's all!"</p>
                <p>"You'll 'ave to," said the voice of
Discipline.</p>
                <p>"'Ave to, I don't think!" said the
rebel ironically; "I couldn't if I'd
lorst it."</p>
                <p>"I ain't got no small kit, any 'ow,"
said the small and husky one; "I put
my 'aversack down when we was
diggin' one of our chaps out of a Jack
Johnson 'ole, and some bloomin' blighter
pinched it! Now that's a thing as I
don't 'old with. Rotten, I call it. I
wouldn't say nothing about it, mind
you, if I was dead; I like to 'ave something
as belonged to a comrade, myself,
an' I know as 'e'd feel the same,
seein' as 'e couldn't want it 'imself.
But, if you take a feller's things w'en
'e's alive, why, you don't know 'ow
bad 'e might want 'em some day."</p>
                <p>"Corporal 'e ses to me, las' kit inspection,"
broke in the fresh-faced
youth, disregarding this nice point of
ethics, "'W'ere's your tooth-brush?'
'e ses. 'Where you won't find it,' I
ses. ''Oo're you talkin' to?' 'e ses.
'Dunno,' I ses; 'the ticket's fell
off!... Wot d'yer call yourself, any'ow,'
I ses, 'you an' yer stripe?' I ses.
'Funny bundle,' I ses, 'that's what I
call you!'"</p>
                <p>"Well, I don't see wot a feller's got
to do," said the propounder of the problem,
returning to the charge. "Granted
as 'e can't walk about naked; granted
as 'e 'asn't got a suit o' civvies of 'is
own—wot <hi rend="it">is</hi> 'e to do?"</p>
                <p>"'Ang on to 'is kar-kee" said the
hoarse-voiced man. The setter-down
of corporals retired within himself,
probably to compose some humorous
repartee.</p>
                <p>The warrant officer came out of
<title>Freckles</title> and suggested writing a letter.</p>
                <p>"'E 'as done. 'E's wrote an' told
'em 'as 'e can't send 'is kar-kee back
until 'e gets a suit o' Martin 'Enry's or
thirty bob in loo of same. An' all as
they done was to write again an'
demand 'is uniform at once."</p>
                <p>The warrant officer sighed and
opined that orders were orders.</p>
                <p>"Yes, but 'e 'd 'ave to carry 'em to
the Post Office naked, wouldn't 'e? An'
'ow about goin' to buy new ones?
That's if 'e 'd drawed 'is pay, which 'e
'asn't.  Unreasonable, that's wot I
calls it."</p>
                <p>"'Asn't 'e got no civvies at all?"
said the small man, beginning to look
sceptical. "'Asn't 'e got no one as 'd
lend 'im a soot? Anyways, 'e could get
some one to post 'em for 'im, an' then
stop in bed till 'is others come."</p>
                <p>"'E's a very lonely feller," said the
champion of the unclad; "'e lives in
lodgin's, an 'e 'asn't got no friends. If
'e 'adn't got no clothes for to fetch 'is
pay in, wot then?"</p>
                <p>A gloomy silence, a silence fraught
with the inevitability of destiny, settled
on the party.</p>
                <p>The warrant officer, who had been
pretending to resume <title>Freckles</title>, presently
looked up and suggested that he
could go in his uniform to a tailor,
explain the position and obtain clothes
on credit.</p>
                <p>The originator of the problem thought
hard for a minute.</p>
                <p>"'E isn't a man as I'd care to trust
myself," he said rather unexpectedly,
"an' I don't think no one else would
neither."</p>
                <p>It was at this point that the man
from H.M.S. <title>Hedgehog</title> (or, to be precise,
H.M.S. <title>Something Else</title>) fell into
the conversation suddenly, like a bomb.</p>
                <p>"'E wouldn't be naked," he said
earnestly; "'e'd 'ave 'is shirt."</p>
                <p>This was a staggerer.  One of those
great simple truths sometimes overlooked
by more abstruse thinkers. But
the owner of the problem made one
more stand.</p>
                <p>"'Oo'd walk about in a shirt?" he
said scornfully.</p>
                <p>"Me," said the large seaman,
"time I was torpedoed...."</p>
                <p>He didn't say another word; but the
problem was irretrievably lost. There
had been something magnificently
daring about the idea of a man walking
about like a lost cherub; partly clothed,
nobody cared very much what became
of him.</p>
                <p>Besides, we all wanted to hear Admiralty
secrets. We sat there in
respectful silence while the train
rattled on its way; but the large seaman
only went on smiling peacefully
to himself, as if he were ruminating in
immense satisfaction upon unprecedented
bags of submarines.</p>

                    <p>"It is not often," says a writer of
what is called "Literary Intelligence,"
"that a novelist adopts a living fellow-worker
as the central figure of his
story. This is, however, the case with
<title>My Lady of the Moor</title>, which Messrs.
<name rend="sc">Longmans</name> will shortly publish for Mr.
<name rend="sc">John Oxenham</name>. While wandering on
Dartmoor he stumbled into a living
actual romance, of which Miss <name rend="sc">Beatrice
Chase</name>, author of several popular books
about Dartmoor, was the centre. This
book tells the tale, which is named after
Miss <name rend="sc">Chase</name>, <title>My Lady of the Moor</title>, and
it has of course been written with her
full consent and approval."</p>
                    <p>But the "Literary Intelligencer" did
not know that Mr. <name rend="sc">Oxenham</name> is not the
dazzling innovator that he might be
thought. Why, even at the moment
that Mr. <name rend="sc">Oxenham</name> was serving up Miss
<name rend="sc">Chase</name> on toast, but always, of course,
with perfect taste, Miss <name rend="sc">Chase</name> was
performing the same culinary business
for him. For her next novel, to be entitled
with great charm <title>My Gentleman
of the Cheek</title>, will present a faithful
picture of the gifted <name rend="sc">John</name> and the
figure he cut on Dartymoor all among
the thikkies and down-alongs and tors.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <name rend="sc">Hall Caine</name>, having just been
pleading in public for more War realism
from literary artists, has in preparation
a fascinating new romance entitled
<title>Marie of Stratford</title>, which depicts, with
all this master's restraint, power and
genius, various phases in the life of a
sister-novelist of whose existence he
has recently heard. Nothing at once
so charming and so arresting has been
published for days.</p>
                    <p>It is announced that Miss <name rend="sc">Marie
Corelli</name>, who for too long has vouchsafed
nothing fresh to her countless
admirers, has just completed the (Isle
of) Manuscript of a story which, like
all her works, is epoch-making. Connoisseurs
of literature, always eager for
a new <hi rend="it">frisson</hi>, will be fascinated to
learn that this novel has for its subject
a fellow-novelist of whose retired existence
she has but lately become aware.
It takes the form of a saga and is
entitled <title>Hall of the Three Legs</title>. Editions
of a size commensurate with the
scarcity of paper are being prepared.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile we are informed that

                <p>
                    <title>Tuesday, March 7th.</title>—The House of
Commons to-day devoted itself to the
process curiously known as "getting
the <name rend="sc">Speaker</name> out of the Chair." The
phrase suggests reluctance on the part
of the occupant to leave his seat; though
I cannot recall any occasion when the
employment of force has been
necessary to persuade Mr.
<name rend="sc">Lowther</name> to resign to the
Chairman of Committees
the duty of listening to dull
speeches. But this afternoon
I can imagine that the
<name rend="sc">Speaker</name> would have been
well content to remain. For
there was fun brewing. Mr.
<name rend="sc">Balfour</name> was to introduce
the Naval Estimates, and his
dear friend and ex-colleague,
Colonel <name rend="sc">Winston Churchill</name>,
was announced to follow him.
The conjunction of these
highly-electrified bodies is
always apt to produce sparks.
The House was well filled,
and over the clock could be
seen Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name>, like "a
sweet little cherub that sits up
aloft to keep watch for the
life of poor Jacky." The
last time Mr. <name rend="sc">Churchill</name>
spoke of Naval affairs in the
House he was not quite nice
to Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name>. Would he
be nicer this time?</p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic url="images/186.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>I think Mr. <name rend="sc">Balfour</name> must
be something of a thought-reader.
Intermingled with
his narration of the varied
and wonderful achievements
of the Fleet, past and present,
his description of the constant
efforts to increase it
both in ships and men, and
his quietly confident prophecy
that with this sure shield we
might face the future in
cheerful serenity, there were
little sidethrusts at an imaginary
critic. Some people
had been silly enough to
suggest that the new Board
of Admiralty was so content
with what had been done by "my
right hon. and learned—I beg his
pardon—gallant friend" that it had
adopted a policy of "rest and be thankful".
But there was no justification
for "a certain kind of sub-acid
pessimism that sometimes reaches my
ears", and he must be a poor-spirited
creature who, having been happy about
the Navy in August, 1914, could be
depressed about in March, 1916.</p>
                <p>Then Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name> proceeded
to put the cap on. He has been
studying the problems of sea-power
in the trenches of Flanders, and the
process has led him to gloomy conclusions.
Suppose the Germans have
been building more ships than we
have: suppose they have put into them
bigger guns than we wot of; suppose
they were to come out at their selected
moment and found us at our average
moment.... The House was beginning
to be a little weary of these
depressing hypotheses when it was
suddenly brought up all standing by
the discovery that the orator was
delivering a eulogy on Lord Fisher.
He was the man who got things
done in a hurry.  He was the man
who had the driving power. They
had "parted brass-rags" over Gallipoli,
it was true; but by-gones were by-gones.
Having been away for some
months, his mind was now clear (irreverent
laughter), and he had come to
recognise that his former foe was the
only possible First Sea Lord.</p>
                <p>It must have been a little embarrassing
for Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name> to sit still and
hear his praises thus chanted. But it
is difficult to escape from the seat over
the Clock without treading upon other
people's toes, and this Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name>
is notoriously averse from
doing. The moment, however,
that Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name>
had finished he left the
Gallery; but before he could
wholly emerge he had to
suffer the further shock of
being cheered by some over-enthusiastic
admirers behind
him. It was a pity he left
so soon, for later Sir <name rend="sc">Hedworth
Meux</name>, fresh from
Portsmouth, had some things
to say which would not have
compelled his blushes.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Wednesday, March 8th.</title>—Members
wondered yesterday
why no reply to Colonel
<name rend="sc">Churchill</name> was forthcoming
from the Treasury Bench.
Mr. <name rend="sc">Balfour</name> made ample
amends to-day for the
omission. There is something
in the personality of
his critic—memories of Lord
<name rend="sc">Randolph</name>, perhaps—that
seems to put on extra polish
on Mr. <name rend="sc">Balfour's</name> rapier
when he deals with him.
Who that heard it will ever
forget his inimitable description
of the then <name rend="sc">Home
Secretary</name> superintending—"with
a photographer"—the
historic Siege of Sidney
Street? This afternoon his
sword-play was equally brilliant;
and there was even more
force behind the thrusts. If
there had been delay in the
progress of the new Dreadnoughts
why was it? Because
his right hon. predecessor had
diverted the guns and gun-mountings
intended for them
into his new-fangled monitors.
He had boasted of his
own rapid shipbuilding. It had indeed
been rapid—so much so that some of
the vessels thus hastily constructed had
now been remodelled. Coming to the
proposed "remedy"—the recall of
Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name> to the Board of Admiralty—Mr.
<name rend="sc">Balfour</name> assumed a sterner
tone. He reminded the house that
Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name> had been accused by his
present champion of not having given
him clear guidance or firm support
over the Gallipoli Expedition. Colonel
<name rend="sc">Churchill's</name> present opinion of Lord
<pb xml:id="page187" n="pg 187"/>
                    <name rend="sc">Fisher</name> was totally inconsistent with
that which he had expressed a few
months ago: possibly they were both
remote from the truth. But it was an
amazing proposition that the Government
should be asked to dismiss Sir
<name rend="sc">Henry Jackson</name>, an officer who was
everything that Lord <name rend="sc">Fisher</name> according
to Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name> was not. He
himself would not yield an inch to such
a demand.</p>
                <p>Spontaneous debate has never been
the Colonel's strong point. His oratorical
engines are driven by midnight
oil. Wisely, therefore, he did
not attempt an elaborate <title>réplique</title> to
Mr. <name rend="sc">Balfour's</name> "sword-play," but contented
himself with a brief restatement
of his case.</p>
                <p>
                    <title>Thursday, March 9th.</title>—Prophets
swarm in both Houses of Parliament,
but the House of Lords is unique in
possessing one who confines himself to
subjects which he has at his fingers'
ends and whose prophecies have a habit
of coming true. What Lord <name rend="sc">Montagu
of Beaulieu</name> does not know of the
petrol engine, and its use on land or
sea or in the air, is not worth knowing.
Seven years ago he warned his countrymen
of the bomb-dropping possibilities
of the new German air-ships. A little
later he pointed out that it was very
doubtful if dirigible balloons could be
successfully attacked by gunfire from
the ground, and that the only effective
way of opposing them was to meet
like with like. Again in 1913 he dwelt
upon the inadequacy of our aerial
defences.</p>
                <p>His object to-day was not to extol
his own merits as a prophet, but to
get the Government to act on the motto
"One Element One Service" and
establish a single Ministry of the Air.
Lord <name rend="sc">Haldane</name> thought we ought to do
some "violent thinking" before adopting
the proposal, but quite agreed (with
a reminiscent glance at the Woolsack)
that we had not made sufficient use of
lighter-than-air machines. That was
Lord <name rend="sc">Beresford's</name> view, too; we must
oppose Zeps to Zeps. Then, having
evidently done some violent thinking
over the recent debate in the
Commons he launched out into a
wholly irrelevant attack upon Colonel
<name rend="sc">Churchill</name> for trying to create anxiety
about the Fleet, and appealed to Lord
<name rend="sc">Fisher</name> (who was not present though
Lord <name rend="sc">Beresford</name> had particularly invited
him) to repudiate the agitation conducted
by the honourable Member for
<name rend="sc">Dundee</name>, a few newspapers and twenty
sandwichmen. Lord <name rend="sc">Lansdowne</name> subsequently
noted that this most irregular
digression appeared to be "not wholly
distasteful" to the peers assembled.
Turning to Lord <name rend="sc">Montagu's</name> proposal
he pointed out that the Government
had gone some way to meet it by
setting up Lord <name rend="sc">Derby's</name> Committee.
But, though prepared to see the Cabinet
increased to a round couple of dozen,
he was not convinced that the only way
to remove imperfections was to appoint
a new Minister to deal with them.</p>
                <p>It seems probable therefore that
there is no truth in the report that
Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name> has been asked to
join the Government as Minister of
Admonitions.</p>

of Organs" (R. A. M. C. ).</quote>
                <p>Charles, the young Army Medical,
went down on one patella. His heart
(a hollow muscular pump) was driving
blood from its ventricles as it had
never yet driven it in all its twenty-five
years of incessant labour. Further, by
flattening the arch of his diaphragm
and elevating his ribs and sternum,
Charles was increasing the cavity of
his thorax and taking in air. Immediately
the diaphragm and the sternum
and costal cartilages relaxed again the
air escaped. The lungs of Charles
were doing their work. Fast and yet
faster became his breathing.</p>
                <p>"Mabel," he murmured, "Mabel!"</p>
                <p>The girl made no movement. Her
respiration continued, but no impulse
to action reached her nerve-centres.
Yet, without an effort on her part, her
tissues in one minute produced enough
heat to boil one twenty-fourth of a pint
of water.</p>
                <p>"Wonderful!" he whispered hoarsely,
probably thinking of this, "you are
wonderful."</p>
                <p>You will not marvel that his voice
was gruff when I tell you that the
membrane of the larynx was inflamed.
Greater men than Charles have become
hoarse in such circumstances.</p>
                <p>Immediately the blood rushed to the
capillaries of Mabel's cheeks and her
colour deepened. She trembled slightly.</p>
                <p>"There, that's it!" he cried, gazing
rapturously.</p>
                <p>"What?" she gasped, startled by
his passion.</p>
                <p>"Again that artery below your ear
is throbbing, throbbing, and"—his
voice rose in despair—"I can never
remember the name! Can you?"</p>
                <p>"Alas," she moaned, "I do not
know it! Oh, Charles, there is something
I must tell you at once."</p>
                <p>"What is it?" he cried with sudden
fear. "What is it?"</p>
                <p>"Why, I—I——Oh, I do not know
how to say it. Charles, you will never
forgive me!"</p>
                <p>"What is it, dearest? Tell me—you
can trust me. The medical profession——"</p>
                <p>"Well, then, I tried to bandage
little Johnny's foot yesterday, and—and——"</p>
                <p>"Calm yourself, dear. And——?"</p>
                <p>"I tied a 'granny' knot. Oh, Charles,
<title>don't</title> be angry. I <hi rend="it">know</hi> it ought to
have been a 'reef'!"</p>
                <p>He looked about him dully, like
a man stunned.</p>
                <p>"Charles," she moaned, "listen!
After all, I put it on the wrong
foot."</p>
                <p>He started violently.</p>
                <p>"Mabel," he cried, "you are sure?
Then I will not let you go. Had you
tied that 'granny' knot on the right
foot, I—we—as an R.A.M.C. man,
I——"</p>
                <p>She clung to him sobbingly.</p>
                <p>"Charles, oh Charles," she panted,
"you have proved it to me. You love
me! (Is my heart throbbing now?)
You love me and it will break for
joy!"</p>
                <p>The phalanges and the metacarpal
bones of her left hand clicked together
as if in sympathy as she flung it to her
side.</p>
                <p>Again her cerebrum flashed its joyful
message, so that she repeated, "My
heart!"</p>
                <p>At the word Charles, the R.A.M.C.
man, rose from his patella and placed
his hands firmly on his femur bones.</p>
                <p>His whole bearing had changed.</p>
                <p>"This," he said slowly and ringingly,
"is the end. When I entered
this room I loved you—I admit it.
But—you have deceived me! Look at
that hand! It is covering—what? The
floating costae! Your heart is not
where you would have me believe.
It is fully three inches higher and
more to the right. That is not a small
matter, or one with which you should
trifle as you do. But you have deceived
me in a greater than that."</p>
                <p>"Oh, what is it? What have I
done?" sobbed Mabel hysterically.</p>
                <p>"The greater matter," continued
Charles in trumpet tones, "is that <title>the
heart is not the seat of the emotions at
all</title>. I can only conclude that your
agitation was feigned. I wish you
good-day, Madam."</p>
                <p>He had reached the door when she
cried aloud.</p>
                <p>"Charles!"</p>
                <p>An urgent message from Charles's
cerebellum, delivered to certain motor
nerves by way of the spinal cord, disposed
him to turn on his heel.</p>
                <p>He waited in silence.</p>
                <p>"Charles dearest, if it was the wrong
place, and I didn't cover my heart after
all, why, Charles, remember Johnny's
foot and be logical!"</p>
                <p>She was there before him, glorious,
and Charles stood dazzled.</p>
                <p>"You are right!" he cried. "Mabel!
If you <hi rend="it">had</hi> covered your heart!!"</p>
                <p>"Charles!!!"</p>

                    <head>A Biographical Note.</head>
                    <p>Considerable promise was shown
in the speech delivered before the House
of Commons last week by Colonel
<name rend="sc">Churchill</name>. His utterance had the
effect of instantly lifting that gallant
gentleman from the obscurity of life
"somewhere in France" to something
approaching notoriety. Surely few
soldiers have discovered such a gift of
dialectical skill; and the Army must
feel proud to learn that it possesses
an officer who shows himself to be as
able in the realm of politics as in the
profession of arms.</p>
                    <p>Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill's</name> sensational <title>tour
de force</title> has aroused a natural interest
in his personality. He is still a
young man, being only just on the
wrong side of forty. In choosing a
military career he responded to hereditary
impulse, for he is a direct descendant
of that great military genius,
the Duke of <name rend="sc">Marlborough</name>. He entered
the army in 1895, when little
more than a boy. After seeing service
in Cuba and India he fought in the
Egyptian Campaign of 1898, and in a
journalistic capacity took part in the
South African War, the news of his
capture being received in this country
with much feeling. To his skill as a
soldier Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name> adds no
small ability as a writer, and has
published more than one book that has
attracted favourable notice.</p>
                    <p>Following upon his remarkable
speech of the other night, there has
been some discussion as to whether
Colonel <name rend="sc">Churchill</name> will definitely take
up a political career, or return to the
trenches. We have it on good authority
that an old friend, Sir <name rend="sc">Hedworth
Meux</name>, strongly advises him not to
sacrifice his military prospects. On the
other hand, his colleagues at the Front
feel that in the national interest they
are prepared to do their best without
him, in view of the benefit likely to
accrue from his remaining at home.
In any case it is confidently asserted
by those who know him that Colonel
<name rend="sc">Churchill</name> has gone far towards
making a name for himself, and that he
is likely to go further still if the opportunity
is given to him. His future is
certain to be watched with interest.</p>

                    <p>I never open a book by Mr. <name rend="sc">Robert Halifax</name> without a
feeling of pleasant anticipation, nor close one without a
sense of quickened sympathy for my fellow-mortals,
especially those of them who dwell in Camden Town. His
latest story, <title>The Right to Love</title> (<name rend="sc">Methuen</name>), finds him again
on familiar ground; but the inhabitants of Widdiford Street
have all the freshness of real human beings. Perhaps more
than its predecessors <title>The Right to Love</title> is a story with a
purpose and a moral; in it Mr. <name rend="sc">Halifax</name> has illustrated by
two groups of characters the vexed question of marriage
failures and the hard lot of the unwanted woman. But do
not suppose that these characters are merely "cases." On
the contrary, it is because they are realized as understandable
creations of flesh and blood that the disasters of <title>Norah</title>
and <title>Tom Spain</title> and the tragedy of <title>Letty Summerbee's</title>
enforced spinsterhood move one to so personal a concern.
From the moment when <title>Norah</title> and <title>Tom</title> enter their little
house after the short honeymoon to that in which the
tormented young wife finally leaves her worthless husband
for the protection (word rightly used) of his long-suffering
friend one is made to feel that exactly thus and thus the
affair happened, and is happening to like persons every day.
As for <title>Letty</title>, with her restraint, her practical helpfulness
and her occasional outbursts of emotion thwarted and suppressed,
she is a type only too convincing. Perhaps one
might object that Mr. <name rend="sc">Halifax</name> brings an indictment
against society without suggesting any practical remedy.
Also that—as I have noticed before—his humorous characters
have a tendency to edge away from the rest into the
regions of farce. But for all that <title>The Right to Love</title> remains
a simple, sincere and very moving study.</p>
                    <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
                    <p>I like the remark that General <name rend="sc">Joffre</name> made, not to the
horse-marines, but to the remnants of the six thousand
<title>Fusiliers Marins</title> who made up the Naval Brigade at
Dixmude in November, 1914. "You are my best infantrymen,"
he told them; and, if you want to know why, all
you have to do is read <title>Dixmude</title> (<name rend="sc">Heinemann</name>), by <name rend="sc">Charles
le Goffic</name>. For four weeks, shrapnel to right of them,
"saucepans" to left of them, volleyed and thundered,
and for four weeks the six thousand stood in the valley of
death at Dixmude and held up six times as many Boches,
who came on, as one of them said, like bugs. Forty
thousand was the estimate of the number of these marines
formed by a German major who was one of their prisoners;
when he learnt that they were only six he wept with rage
and muttered, "Ah, if we had only known!" Dixmude
was not quite such a big affair as Verdun, but the men
who held the town, "the young ladies with the red
pompoms" on their caps, were first cousins to our own
Jack Tars. Bretons or Britons, there is nothing to choose
between them. Sailors all, they are the salt of the sea;
and this fascinating and circumstantial epic of the French
marines is not at all an exaggerated picture of the cheery
courage and endurance of the Breton fisherman.</p>

                        <title>Sussex Gorse</title> (<name rend="sc">Nisbet</name>) is a story about the fight between
man and nature. It is told by Miss <name rend="sc">Sheila Kaye-Smith</name>
with considerable power and a quickening touch of symbolism
that lifts it into romance. The ambition of <title>Reuben
Backfield</title> was to enlarge the Sussex farm that he had
inherited from his easy-going father till its bounds should
include a certain coveted moor. The book shows how
his entire life was spent in the achievement of this end; how
for it he sacrificed his own ease, and the happiness of his
brother, his two wives and his many children, and how
finally he triumphed, and in his lonely old age, seeing the
desired acres all his own, was content. It is a grim book,
with only now and then a touch of suggested poetry to save
<pb xml:id="page192" n="pg 192"/>
it from being uniformly sordid and depressing. As it is,
the long unsparing struggle takes somehow the dignity of
an epic. Only one of <title>Reuben's</title> many sons makes any
success out of life—<title>Richard</title>, who becomes a barrister, and
treats his father to occasional visits of curiosity and amused
patronage. There is a chapter of cynical humour in which
the intolerant contemptuous old rustic is confronted by the
art-loving triflers who gather in his son's drawing-room.
Otherwise he is alone. "There's no one gone from here as
has ever come back!" But I was glad that Miss <name rend="sc">Kaye-Smith</name>
had the courage to play fair by her hero, and to give
him at last his share of the hard bargain. This is only one
of many qualities that make <title>Sussex Gorse</title> a novel to be
remembered.</p>

                    <p>I can't quite make out what made Mr. <name rend="sc">William
Hewlett</name> persist in <title>Introducing William Allison</title> (<name rend="sc">Secker</name>).
Probably a nice general conviction (rather infectious; I
caught it) of his own cleverness. If his work wants a good
deal of pulling together separate bits of it are confoundedly
well done. The schoolboy
conversations (<title>William</title>
is a Winchester
man, thrown into a lawyer's
clerkship straight
from the sixth) and the
picture of the superbly
groomed associates of his
friend's brother, <title>Marmaduke
Fenton</title>, are cases in
point, though I don't
think Winchester would
have been so absurdly
abashed by the glories
of bachelordom in Half-Moon
Street. So too is
the lecture of <title>Parbury</title>,
the neo-decadent, on the
cultivation of "that
sacred and imperishable
flower, the white unsullied
bloom of an
Intensely Useless Life,"
even if it be only a belated cutting from <title>The Green
Carnation</title>. <title>William's</title> first boyish passion for a quite cold
shop-minx, with its agonies of self-abasement and rarefied
desire, is uncannily clever; and the thoroughly unpleasant
episode of our <title>William</title>, minx-free, only to be caught in the
toils of that insatiable sensualist, Mrs. <title>Daintree</title>, is presented
with discreet vigour. There is possibly a moral in the
fascinating <title>Marmaduke's</title> desperate half-hour in Dr. <title>Ferox's</title>
consulting-room. But Mr. <name rend="sc">Hewlett</name> never wrote this
flippant tale to point a moral. Rather, as I suggest, he
seems to have said, "These are samples of several <hi rend="it">genres</hi>
in which I can succeed on my head.  Some day I will
really finish something. Meanwhile pray be amused."</p>

                    <p>Of Miss <name rend="sc">Ethel Dell's</name> popularity there seems to be no
possible doubt, and her publishers, Messrs. <name rend="sc">Hutchinson</name>,
assure me that her latest, <title>The Bars of Iron</title>, is the best
novel she has written. While accepting their unprejudiced
judgment I retain the liberty of remaining unimpressed.
Miss <name rend="sc">Dell</name> has an eye for a plot and she can make things
move; but her methods are too feverish for my taste. A
man-fight in the prologue is followed by a dog-fight in the
first chapter, and through the early part of the book the
<title>Rev. S. Lorimer</title> beats his numerous family again and again.
It is true that, between her explosions, she introduces
certain lovable characters, but they fail to correct the
general atmosphere of violence. Neither the beauty of
<title>Piers Evesham</title> (his naked shoulders looked "like a piece
of faultless statuary, god-like, superbly strong"), nor his
sympathy with children, offers adequate compensation for
his volcanic temperament. If Miss <name rend="sc">Dell</name>, who seems to
have a penchant for tempestuous heroes, would devote
some of her superfluous energy to a study of men, so as
to get to understand them as well as she understands her
own sex, it would be a good thing for the quality both of
her work and of her public.</p>
                    <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
                    <p>In her latest little volume of verse, modestly entitled
<title>Simple Rhymes for Stirring Times</title> (<name rend="sc">Pearson</name>), Miss <name rend="sc">Jessie
Pope</name> shows that she has not only the right spirit, but a
sense of form beyond the common. She does not pretend
to heroics and she seldom allows herself to touch a note of
pathos; her mission is just to inspire other hearts with
the infectious gay courage of her own. It finds a natural
expression in the easy lilt of her measures. She is fluent
rather than polished and never overlays her designs with
excess of embroidery.
Long practice has made
her familiar with a craft
which is not so easy as
it looks; and in particular
she has learnt the
art of the final line. Miss
<name rend="sc">Pope</name> may possibly run
the risk of over-writing
herself; but so long as
she brings a discriminating
eye to the choice of
what is worth preserving—and
she has been
<hi rend="it">quite</hi> reasonably self-critical
in her present
selection—the matter
that she jettisons is no
affair of mine. Judging
only by what I see here,
I recognise that, in whatever
other way she may
be helping the cause,
through her gift of light-heart verse she is doing—and none
more bravely—her share of woman's work.</p>
